## Topology

If you have just received your license serials, please refer to the [Getting Started](/server/getting-started/) topic.

A {{ en.RDMS }} instance is actually a web application. This allows for exposing its services on the Internet or an Intranet.  

The recommended [Topology](/server/overview/topologies/) is the use of two servers: a Database server and a Web server. For smaller installations, a single server can be used, but resources will be shared between the two user groups, thereby affecting performance.  

{% snippet icon.badgeInfo %} 
The {{ en.RDMSCONSOLE }} is now offered as a stand alone application. It is available on the [Devolutions download page](https://server.devolutions.net/home/download) . 
{% endsnippet %}
 
{% snippet icon.badgeCaution %} 
Please ensure before starting the installation that you have .NET 4.8 installed on your machine. Available to download from this Microsoft link: [.NET Framework 4.8 Offline Installer](https://api.devolutions.net/redirection/a2ad328a-b3a3-4e04-977a-a3e8681f00dc) . 
{% endsnippet %}
 
{% snippet icon.shieldWarning %} 
It is highly recommended to enable SSL Encryption in order to protect communication with the instance of the SQL Server. Please follow the instructions from Microsoft on [How to enable SSL encryption](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316898) . Note that we recommend this be done after the initial setup is complete.

{% snippet icon.badgeInfo %} 
For full Active Directory integration, the application pool uses a domain identity. Both servers need to be joined to the domain.
