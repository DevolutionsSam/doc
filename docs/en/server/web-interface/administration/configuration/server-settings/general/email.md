Emails are sent by our notification engine and by some of our multi-factor authentication providers for internal secure messaging. 

In the ***General*** section, you are able to choose an ***Authentication type*** between ***Basic*** and ***Azure***. You can also provide the ***Administrator Email***, which is the recipient email address that will receive the errors.

After having selected the ***Authentication type***, you will get access to other fields to fill in. The information to provide depends on the authentication type.
