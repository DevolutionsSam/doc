To get the Notification working, at least a [Subscriber](/server/web-interface/administration/security-management/notifications/subscribers/) and a [Subscription](/server/web-interface/administration/security-management/notifications/subscriptions/) need to be created. It is also possible to regroup Subscribers in [Subscriber Groups](/server/web-interface/administration/security-management/notifications/subscriber-groups/) to send notifications to a group of subscribers.  

The following sample represents a notification email that has been received for an entry creation.
