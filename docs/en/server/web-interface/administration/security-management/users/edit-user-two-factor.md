If you set multi-factor authentication (MFA) as [***Optional per user***](/server/web-interface/administration/configuration/server-settings/security/two-factor/) in the ***Server Settings***, you then need to configure which MFA method to use for each user. 

## Settings 
1. In ***Administration – Users***, edit the user for whom you want to configure the MFA.
1. In the ***Multi-factor*** section, select the MFA ***Type*** from the list.

1. You now have two choices. Either:
    * Check ***Configure later by user*** to let the user configure their MFA by themselves when they next connect to {{ en.DVLS }}.

    or

    * Follow the steps to configure the MFA for the user.
