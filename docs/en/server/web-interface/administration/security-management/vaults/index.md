The {{ en.VLT }}s management allows to create and manage {{ en.VLT }}s . To access the {{ en.VLT }}s management, navigate to Administration â€“ {{ en.VLT }} s .  

The ***{{ en.VLT }}*** ***s*** allow users to [create entries](/server/web-interface/vault/entries/create-entries-manually/) and manage the content of the data source. They are containers that divide the data source into multiple compartments.  

We recommend using vaults for improved organization and security. {{ en.VLT }} s also help performance as they limit the amount of entries that load at once.
