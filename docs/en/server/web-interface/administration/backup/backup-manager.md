Backup database file path

		<td>
The path to the folder where the backup of the SQL database will be saved.<br>

We recommend the use of a shared network folder with proper permissions set on it to be able to save the backup file.  

Note: As the backup command is running on the SQL Server and on the machine where {{ en.DPS }} is hosted, this path must be accessible from both. We recommend configuring the database backup path using a UNC path.  

If a service account is set on the ***Scheduler Service*** , the account needs write permission on the destination folder.
