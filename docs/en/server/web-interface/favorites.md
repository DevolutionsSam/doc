title: Favorites

The ***Favorites*** section contains entries flagged as favorite, by the current user, from all the vaults this user has access. ***Favorites*** are not shared and they roam with the user profile.  

This is useful when the number of managed entries becomes too great or when a strict directory structure must be maintained.

Favorite an entry in two ways :  

* by right-clicking an entry in the ***Navigation Pane*** , then selecting ***Add to Favorites*** . 
* by clicking the ***Add to Favorites*** star icon in the action button menu of the entry.  

### Organize the favorites 
To organize your favorite entries, click ***Add Folder*** , in the ***Favorites*** section. Name the folder, then drag and drop from the favorite list to organize them.  

When a ***Favorites*** structure exists and you favorite a new entry, just select the folder in the list to save it within.
