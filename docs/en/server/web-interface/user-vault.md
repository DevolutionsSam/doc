The ***{{ en.PVLT }}*** is a user centric ***{{ en.VLT }}***   used to store personal account information, credentials, and passwords. It allows each user to have their very own   ***{{ en.PVLT }}*** .  

The ***{{ en.PVLT }}*** also prevents users from using a non-secure tool to manage their personal passwords at work.
