The approver gets the following pop-up when clicking on the request where it's possible to either ***Approve*** or ***Deny*** the request and leave an optional message.

If the request is denied, the user will see that their request on the account is no longer pending and was denied in the recent activity field of the main ***Privileged Access*** page. If approved, they will be able to access the account by clicking on the same button they used to submit the request. They'll now get this ***Active Checkout*** window instead of the request one :

Once done with the account, they can use the ***CheckIn*** button on the last window to release their hold on the checkout.  

Privileged accounts' passwords are automatically changed on check-in if the corresponding option is enabled.
