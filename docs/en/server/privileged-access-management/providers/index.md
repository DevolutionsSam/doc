On the creation of a Provider, eight choices are available. Five Managed Provider types : [Domain User](/server/privileged-access-management/providers/domain-provider/) , [SSH Local User](/server/privileged-access-management/providers/local-ssh-provider/) , [SQL User](/server/privileged-access-management/providers/sql-server-provider/) , [Windows Users](/server/privileged-access-management/providers/windows-users-provider/) . A nd [Azure AD User](/server/privileged-access-management/providers/azure-ad-user-provider/) and three Unmanaged Provider types : MySQL User, Cisco User, Oracle User. Multiple Providers can be created and can reach different domains as long as the {{ en.RDMS }} instance can communicate with the domain controller.
