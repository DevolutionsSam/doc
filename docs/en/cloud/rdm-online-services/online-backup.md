The ***{{ en.OBACK }}*** allows you to backup your Devolutions Online Drive, SQLite and XML data sources in a safe online cloud storage. It will automatically save your sessions when you initiate a change in {{ en.RDM }} . 

It is available for free in {{ en.RDM }} Free and Enterprise. 

You will be able to delete your backup files from your ***RDM Online Services*** , but you will have to create the ***{{ en.OBACK }}*** from your {{ en.RDM }} application. 

Consult [Online Backup Settings - Windows Edition](http://help.remotedesktopmanager.com/file_backup_settings.htm) or [Online Backup Settings - Mac Edition](http://helpmac.remotedesktopmanager.com/file_backup_settings.htm) for more information on the configuration.
