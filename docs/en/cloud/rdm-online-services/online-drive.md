The ***{{ en.DOD }}*** is a free cloud file storage service with no limitations and perfect for standalone users. You can store and synchronize your entries online and access your sessions from anywhere. 

{% snippet icon.shieldWarning %} 
Even though this is a cloud service, you MUST use our [Online Backup](/cloud/rdm-online-services/online-backup/) service to keep history of your data. Since Devolutions offers a free backup service, we do not maintain multiple versions of the Online Drive content. This makes it critical that you enable the backup feature. This service will keep multiple versions of your file and is the best option.
