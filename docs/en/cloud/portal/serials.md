The ***Serials*** section allows you to manually add, edit or delete license keys that you want to store in the portal. You can also import it from your invoice if it is associated with this account.  

This location is also where you can find the license to register your {{ en.RDM }} Free and   {{ en.RDMS }} Free .  

{% snippet icon.badgeCaution %} 
The ***Serials*** section is not linked with any of your Devolutions application. It is a listing of your product licensing information only.  

You will be required to save the serial into the appropriate Devolutions application to register.
