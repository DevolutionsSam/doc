Step 1 - Register your license:  

* [Team Registration](/rdm/mac/installation/client/registration/team-edition/) 
* [Trial Registration](/rdm/mac/installation/client/registration/trial-request/) 
		</td>
		<td>
{{ en.RDM }} Team Edition grants you a 30-day trial. If you decide not to register by the end of the trial, your data will not be altered or erased, and you will have full access to it once you provide a license key.

Step 2 - Add your Data Source and set up your Devolutions account and a master key. 
		</td>
		<td>
Warning: When choosing any data source type that is not on-premises , you need to think about the safety of the data at rest and during transport. we strongly recommend that you further encrypt your data by applying a master key for file-based solutions, or a [Security Provider](/rdm/mac/commands/administration/security-provider/) for [Advanced Data Sources](/rdm/mac/data-sources/data-sources-types/advanced-data-sources/) . This ensures only you can read the data.  

Upon first launch, {{ en.RDM }} for Mac uses an SQLite data source. The different data sources are explained in the [Data Source Types](/rdm/mac/data-sources/data-sources-types/) section. For help seecting a data source tailored to your needs, please see [Choosing your data source (Individuals)](/rdm/mac/getting-started/checklist-individuals/select-data-source-type-individuals/) .

Step 3 - Set up your Devolutions {{ en.OBACK }} . 
		</td>
		<td>
Devolutions {{ en.OBACK }} allows you to securely back up your information for selected data sources. The backup is automatically executed 30 seconds after any modifications made to the data source content. It is best practice to always back up your data source. 
		</td>

Step 4 - Create your [Default Settings](/rdm/mac/commands/file/templates/default-settings/) .
