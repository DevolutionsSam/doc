The theme of {{ en.RDM }} for Mac can be changed to better suit your preferences. It modifies the color and shade of the user interface.  

This ***Theme*** setting is available in ***File – Preferences – User Interface*** . The ***Light*** theme is set by default, but you can select the ***Dark*** theme instead if you prefer. The theme will be automatically applied once you click ***OK*** .
