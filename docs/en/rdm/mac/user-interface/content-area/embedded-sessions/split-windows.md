Within a Remote Desktop Manager embedded session is the option to display multiple tabbed windows simultaneously. As illustrated below, select and hold down on a tab and drag it towards the center of the screen to access the four-sided directional control. Aim the directional control to anchor the tab on the top, bottom, left or right of the adjacent tab.
