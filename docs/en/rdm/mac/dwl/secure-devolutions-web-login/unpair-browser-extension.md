title: Unpair a Browser Extension
---
In the event that you want to deny access to {{ en.RDM }} from a previously paired browser extension, you need to delete it from {{ en.RDM }} .  

1. In {{ en.RDM }} , go to ***File – Preferences – Browser Extensions*** . 
1. In the ***{{ en.DWL }}*** ***Associations*** section, right-click the entry and select ***Remove*** . Close the window to save the modifications.  

{% snippet icon.badgeInfo %} 
In the ***{{ en.DWL }}*** ***Associations*** section, you will find a list of each association made to {{ en.RDM }} including some information to identify them. This includes the name specified at the time of association (which defaults to the web browser’s name), a part of the encryption key used between the two, its creation date, and the date when it was last used.
