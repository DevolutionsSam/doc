title: End of License
---
Some of our {{ en.RDM }} for Mac Team users might wonder what happens when their license expires. Here is a breakdown depending on your purchase model. 

### Perpetual 

When you purchase a perpetual license, you always receive 1 year or 3 years maintenance with it. After that period, {{ en.RDM }} for Mac will continue to work indefinitely with the latest version available at the moment of the maintenance expiration. 

If you discover a bug, a security issue, or want to have access to the newest features, you would need to purchase a maintenance plan for your perpetual license. 

### Subscription 

All {{ en.RDM }} Team subscription plans offer software maintenance (1 or 3 years), which includes all major/minor upgrades and technical support. 

You need to renew your subscription agreement upon expiry. If you do not renew your subscription, access to your data will be limited.
