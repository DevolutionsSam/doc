The data source is at the heart of {{ en.RDM }} for Mac , it is the container that holds all of your entries. 

## Settings 

The data source can be a file or a database and you use multiple data sources at the time, as seen below. They need to be configured on all workstations.

### Create a new Data Source 

Please consult our [Create a new data source](/rdm/mac/data-sources/create-new-data-source/) topic for more information. 

### Multiple Data Sources 

You can configure multiple data sources within the application. These data sources can be of mixed types but there is only one active at a time. It is possible to switch from one data source to another via the data source combo box.
