All passwords are encrypted by default by {{ en.RDM }} for Mac . You can specify a custom password to fully encrypt the content of the SQLite database.

{% snippet icon.shieldWarning %} 
Password recovery is not possible, the data will be unrecoverable if you cannot authenticate. Please ensure you backup the password in a safe place. 
{% endsnippet %}
 
{% snippet icon.badgeInfo %} 
SQLite supports an unlimited number of simultaneous readers, but will only allow one writer at any instant in time. For this reason {{ en.RDM }} for Mac does not support sharing an SQLite data source between several users by storing it on a network drive. If you want to share your data and work in a team environment with your colleagues, please use one of the [Advanced Data Sources](/rdm/mac/data-sources/data-sources-types/advanced-data-sources/) . Please consult [SQLite.org](https://www.sqlite.org/whentouse.html) for more information.

## Password management 

You can specify a password to further encrypt your data, you must enter your password when creating your SQLite data source.
