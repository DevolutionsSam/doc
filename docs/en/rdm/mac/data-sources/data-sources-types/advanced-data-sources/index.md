title: Advanced Data Sources
---
***Advanced Data Sources*** are highly configurable data sources, typically running on an advanced management system, such as a database management system or our own Devolutions Online Services.  

Advanced Data Sources greatly increase the set of managing features available to administrators, such as:  

* Document uploads and entry attachments. 
* Audit and logging. 
* Advanced security with [User Management](/rdm/mac/commands/administration/user-management/) and [Security Group Management](Administration_SecurityGroupManagement) .  
* [Offline mode](/rdm/mac/commands/file/go-offline/) . 
* [2-Factor Authentication](/rdm/mac/data-sources/multi-factor-authentication/) .  

Currently, the Advanced Data Sources are:  
* [Devolutions Hub Business](/rdm/mac/data-sources/data-sources-types/advanced-data-sources/hub-business/) . 
* [{{ en.RDMS }}](/rdm/mac/data-sources/data-sources-types/advanced-data-sources/server/) . 
* [Microsoft Azure SQL](/rdm/mac/data-sources/data-sources-types/advanced-data-sources/microsoft-azure-sql/) . 
* [Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL)](/rdm/mac/data-sources/data-sources-types/advanced-data-sources/microsoft-sql-server/) .
