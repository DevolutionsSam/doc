You may have to [add a license](/rdm/mac/commands/administration/licenses/) to your data source. If you are using an [Advanced Data Source](/rdm/mac/data-sources/data-sources-types/advanced-data-sources/) , there is no need to add a license in {{ en.RDM }} as the license serial is retrieved directly from the data source.
