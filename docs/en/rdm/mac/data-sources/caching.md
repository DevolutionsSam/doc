title: Caching
---
The caching mode will determine how the client will re-load entries when changes are detected. On large data sources caching is a must and will increase performance significantly. 

{% snippet icon.badgeInfo %} 
This feature is only available when using an [Advanced Data Source](/rdm/mac/data-sources/data-sources-types/advanced-data-sources/) . 
{% endsnippet %}
 
{% snippet icon.badgeNotice %} 
If the cache is outdated, press Ctrl+Refresh or Ctrl+F5 to refresh the local cache. This will force reading from the database to recreate the cache. 
{% endsnippet %}
 
## Settings 

The Caching ***mode*** option can be accessed via File – Data Sources – Edit Data Source – Advanced in an advanced data source.

### Storage 

You can find the configuration file by doing a right click on your Finder - Go to Folder and in the Folder dialog type &#160;~/Library.  

You can then follow the path Application Support/com.devolutions.remotedesktopmanager select the pertaining database where you will find the offline.db file.  

The file is a SQLite database encrypted using a non-portable computed key hash.  

{% snippet icon.shieldNotice %} 
You can enhance the security of the offline file by setting the Enhanced security in the Data Sources Preferences – [Offline Security](/rdm/mac/commands/file/preferences/security/) . 
{% endsnippet %}
 
{% snippet icon.badgeHelp %} 
Depending on the configuration of the Caching Mode and of the Offline Mode the Offline.db file may still exist since the file has as a dual purpose caching and offline line support.
