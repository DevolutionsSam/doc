## Settings 

### System 

The administrator item could be the possible source for security problem. This happens often when a user has the SYSDBA or is DB_OWNER of the SQL Server database.  

Some other issues could be related to the fact that the application is running in Terminal Services. However Remote Desktop Manager is fully compatible with Terminal Services.  

FIPS related issues and solutions can be found in the specific FIPS (Encryption) troubleshooting section.
