You can apply a Master Key to encrypt the data files of the following data source:  

* [XML](DataSource_Xml) 
* [Dropbox](DataSource_Dropbox) 

![Master Key ](/img/en/rdm/mac/clip10099.png) 

It is generally recommended to apply a Master Key to your XML or Dropbox Data Sources as it adds another layer of security protecting your Remote Sessions.  

The use of a Master Key function will stop unauthorized users from being able to easily see/access the stored Sessions within your Data Source.

If you ever lose your master key it will be impossible for us to recover your data. Please ensure that you remember or backup your master key in a safe place.
