You can access the default session settings from File - Template - Default session settings.  

This allows you to edit or reset your default settings that are used whenever a new entry is created. Every entry type is supported and can have a default template defined.  

By editing your default template you will be able to save settings often used when creating new entries. 

## Settings 

### No template defined 

Notice that a [No default] notice is displayed below each type that doesn't have a default template defined.
