title: Go Offline

Go offline connects to a local copy of the data source when the data source is not available. It can be used when a user is working from a disconnected network or when there is any kind of connectivity issues with the data source. 

{% snippet icon.shieldinfo %} 
There are settings in both the data source and the user account that may prevent you from using the Offline Mode. Ask you administrator if the menu is not visible. 
{% endsnippet %}
 
{% snippet icon.shieldCaution %} 
There are security considerations to take into account when enabling the Offline Mode. 
{% endsnippet %}
 
Remote Desktop Manager will prompt for offline mode when the application is unable to reach the data source.  

You can manually activate the offline mode by using the menu File - Go Offline . When the connection is back online use the menu File - Go Online or the Refresh icon to reconnect to the data source.  

Some options will not be available in the Offline mode:  

* Documents. 
* Attachments and logs. 
* [User management](/rdm/mac/commands/administration/user-management/) (Add/Edit/Delete users).
