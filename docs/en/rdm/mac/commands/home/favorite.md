This is useful when the number of managed entries becomes too great or if you must maintain a strict directory structure to hold your entries. You can create a list of your Favorite entries to make it easier to access them.

## Settings 

There are two types of favorite sessions: 

* Shared favorites : Shared by all users who are connected to the data source, and are directly configured from the session. 
* Local favorites : Flagged locally on the current machine by the current user. The settings are saved in the application settings. 

The blue star indicates a shared favorite and the yellow star a local favorite.
