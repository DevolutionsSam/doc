The Multi Vault Search feature of {{ en.RDM }} for Mac allows you to search for folders and entries in all the vaults of the selected data source at once.

### Criteria Types 

The following criteria are available to refine your search: ***Connection type*** , ***Creation date*** , ***Folder*** , ***Last update date*** , ***Name*** and ***Software*** .

At least one criterion must be used to filter your results, and a maximum of four criteria can be applied at once.

Drop-down lists will appear when selecting certain criteria to give you more search options.

Select from the list the period of time, up to 90 days ago, when the entries/folders were created or last updated.

* ***Starts with*** - any name beginning with the characters you have entered. 
* ***Ends with*** - any name ending with the characters you have entered. 
* ***Exact expression*** - any name exactly matching every character you have entered.

### Results Display 

The results are displayed when the ***Search*** button is pressed. Once done, the name of all entries and the vault in which they are located are shown in the results field.  
![Search Button](/img/en/rdm/mac/RDMMac0031.png) 

It is possible to select multiple entries at once by shift-clicking or all of them with the Cmd+A shortcut. Right-clicking one or more entries shows the same menu and options as in the ***{{ en.NPANE }}*** . 

### Other functions 

The ***Select in*** ***{{ en.NPANE }}*** button, when pressed, takes you directly to the selected entry or folder in the corresponding vault's ***{{ en.NPANE }}*** .  

The ***Reset*** button clears all your search results and options, giving you a clean slate for a new search.
