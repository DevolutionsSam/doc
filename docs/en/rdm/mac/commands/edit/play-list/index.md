title: Play List
---
The Play List feature in {{ en.RDM }} for Mac is a lot like a music play list. The Play List can be used to create groups of sessions for a specific task or for security reasons. You can build your own Play List and start all entries from a Play List at the same time.  

The Play List feature is accessible from View - Play List .
