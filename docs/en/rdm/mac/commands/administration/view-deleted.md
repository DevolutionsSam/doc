## Settings 

### Manage Deleted Entries 

The View deleted will generate a list containing all the entries previously deleted from your data source. You may resurrect an entry, meaning it will become an active entry again and will be shown in your data source. You may also chose to permanently delete your entries, once you have permanently deleted your entries you won&apos;t be able to resurrect them afterward.
