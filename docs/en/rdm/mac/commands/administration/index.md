The Administration ribbon is only available for the Administrator of the data source since it is mostly used to manage settings and users of a data source. If the options are grayed out contact your administrator.  

Also most features contained in the Administration menu requires an [Advanced Data Source](/rdm/mac/data-sources/data-sources-types/advanced-data-sources/) .
