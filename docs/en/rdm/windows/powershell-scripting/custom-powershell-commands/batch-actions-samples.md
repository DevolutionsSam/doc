title: Batch Actions Samples
---
The ***Batch Actions*** allow for a quick way to modify multiple sessions at once, but within {{ en.RDM }} itself.  

To be able to create your PowerShell script, you would need the name of the field(s) that you would like to update. To retrieve the exact name of the field, right-click on your session and select Clipboard â€“ Copy . You can then paste the information in a text editor to retrieve the name of the field(s) that you would like to modify via the Custom PowerShell Command.  

Since they use the Powershell technology, we provides samples in this section because the fields are the same when accessed through our Batch Actions or through Powershell.  

## Samples 

### Disable Only send password in HTML Password Field option in Website sessions 

```powershell
$connection.Web.OnlySendPasswordInPasswordField = $false; 
$RDM.Save ( ) ; 
```

### Enable View Url Embedded (Information Entries) 

```powershell
$connection.DataEntry.ViewUrlDisplayMode = "Default"; 
$RDM.Save(); 
```
```powershell
ViewUrlDisplayMode: "Default" = embedded, "External" = external. 
```
### Open URL (external) for Web Login (Information Entries) 

```powershell
$connection.DataEntry.DefaultAction = "OpenUrlExternal"; 
$RDM.Save(); 
```
### SSH Shell Batch Edit (Session Type Settings) 

```powershell
$connection.Terminal.MaxScrollbackLines = 2000; 

$connection.Terminal.AlwaysAcceptFingerprint = $true; 

$connection.Terminal.EnableLogging = $true; 
$connection.Terminal.LogPath = '$LOGPATH$\$NAME$_$DATE_TEXT_ISO$_$TIME_TEXT_ISO$.log'; 
$connection.Terminal.LogMode = 1; 
$connection.Terminal.LogOverwriteMode = 0; 
$RDM.Save(); 
```

Here are some values that you can change for this command;  

LogPath: your path between ' ' (single quotes). You can also use variables. i.e. %USERPROFILE%, $NAME$, etc. In this example $LOGPATH$ is a custom variable defined in the [Data Source Settings (System Settings) - Custom Variables](/rdm/windows/commands/administration/settings/system-settings/application/).

```powershell
LogMode: 1 = Printable Output, 0 = Event  
TerminalLogOverwriteMode: 0 = default, 1 = prompt, 2 = append, 3 = overwrite  
```

Here's also other options that you can modify; 

```powershell
$connection.Terminal.BellMode = 'Visual' 
$connection.Terminal.CloseOnDisconnect = $false 
```
### Convert WebSite sessions into LogMeIn sessions 

```powershell
$connection.ConnectionType = 'LogMeIn'; 
$connection.ConnectionSubType = ' '; 
$connection.LogMeIn.Url = $connection.WebBrowserUrl; 
$RDM.Save(); 
```
#### Enable the "Hide script errors in all your LogMeIn sessions." 

```powershell
$connection.LogMeIn.ScriptErrorsSuppressed = $true; 
$RDM.Save(); 
```

#### Hide navigation bar. 

```powershell
$connection.LogMeIn.ShowUrl = $false; 
$RDM.Save(); 
```

#### Change the Web Browser Application. 

```powershell
$connection.LogMeIn.WebBrowserApplication = "GoogleChrome"; 
$RDM.Save(); 
```
#### Enable the Sandbox Process. 

```powershell
$connection.LogMeIn.SandboxProcess = $true; 
$RDM.Save(); 
```
#### Change the URL. 

```powershell
$connection.LogMeIn.Url = " "; 
$RDM.Save(); 
```
#### Change the Portal Login field. 

```powershell
$connection.LogMeIn.DashboardHostUrl = " "; 
$RDM.Save(); 
```

#### Change Username & Password. 

Please run these two one at a time 

Host; 

```powershell
$connection.LogMeIn.UserName = " "; 
$RDM.Save(); 
```
```powershell
$connection.LogMeIn.SafePassword = " "; 
$RDM.Save(); 
```

Portal; 

```powershell
$connection.LogMeIn. DashboardEmail = " "; 
$RDM.Save(); 
```
```powershell
$connection.LogMeIn. SafePasswordDashboard = " "; 
$RDM.Save(); 
```

### Change a custom field value without changing the data 

```powershell
$connection.MetaInformation.CustomField3Title = "MyField" 
$RDM.Save(); 
```
Please note that you would need to change "MyField" for the value that you want to replace Custom field #3 with.

### Change the expiration date of an RDP session 

The date must be specified using the ISO8601 format.

$RDM.Save(); 
```

### Change the expiration date of an RDP session with a relative date
