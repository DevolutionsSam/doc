There are two ways to interact with {{ en.RDM }} using PowerShell:  

<table>
	<tr>
		<td>

[Module](/rdm/windows/powershell-scripting/powershell-module/) 
		</td>
		<td>
Devolutions.PowerShell Module: It is a module that exposes many cmdlets that are used to "pilot" a local installation of {{ en.RDM }} . As such, it is quite different from most modules available out there since the majority is used to communicate with a remote service. This means that it requires an interactive Windows session in a user context. 
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
[Custom Actions](/rdm/windows/powershell-scripting/custom-powershell-commands/) 
		</td>
		<td>
Snippets of PowerShell code that can be executed directly in {{ en.RDM }} . The actions can be initiated using Edit – Edit (Special Actions) – Custom PowerShell Command. The advantages of this approach are the following:  

1. There is no need to handle the loading of the appropriate module for the instance of {{ en.RDM }} . 
1. There is no need to handle the filtering of entries. Most of the time, you would perform manual selection directly in your ***{{ en.NPANE }}*** or, even better, use the ***Advanced Search*** to select entries in one fell swoop.
