The data sources are at the heart of {{ en.RDM }} . They are the container that holds entries. 

### Settings 

A data source can be a local file or a database (either local or shared). Multiple data sources can be managed at the same time as seen below.

### Create a data source 

Please consult our [Create a new data source](/rdm/windows/data-sources/create-new-data-source/) topic for more information. 

### Multiple data sources 

Multiple data sources can be configured, but there is only one active at a time.
