* The data source supports auto refresh. 
* This is a file-based data source, based on the XML data source. 
* To avoid data corruption, the session list should be modified in one location at a time. 
* No need to have the Dropbox client installed to use the Dropbox data source. 
* Each Dropbox data source can use a different Dropbox account. 

{% snippet icon.badgeCaution %} 
Although it can be shared between multiple locations, there is no conflict management for the configuration. If you share with other users you may get update conflicts and run into issues. This data source type is meant for a single   user using multiple computers, not multiple users .
