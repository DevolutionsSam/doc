{{ en.RDM }} &apos;s SQLite data source is ideal for single user and stand-alone situations. More powerful and more flexible than the XML file format, it also supports a few of the Advanced Data Source options like Logs and Attachments.

## Highlights 

* Full connection log and attachments support. 
* The [{{ en.OBACK }} Service](/cloud/rdm-online-services/online-backup/) is available for this data source. 

{% snippet icon.shieldInfo %} 
All passwords are encrypted by default by {{ en.RDM }} . You can specify a custom password to fully encrypt the content of the SQLite database. 
{% endsnippet %}
 
{% snippet icon.shieldWarning %} 
Password recovery is not possible, the data will be unrecoverable if you cannot authenticate. Please ensure you backup the password in a safe place. 
{% endsnippet %}
 
{% snippet icon.badgeInfo %} 
SQLite supports an unlimited number of simultaneous readers, but will only allow one writer at any instant in time. For this reason {{ en.RDM }} does not support sharing a SQLite data source between several users by storing it on a network drive. If you want to share your data and work in a team environment with your colleagues, please use one of the [Advanced Data Sources](/rdm/windows/data-sources/data-sources-types/advanced-data-sources/) . Please consult [SQLite.org](https://www.sqlite.org/whentouse.html) for more information.

## Password management 

You can specify a password to further encrypt your data. Specify it at creation time. If the data source already exists you can modify the password by using the File ***â€“*** Manage Password dialog.  

Change or clear the password of a SQLite data source.
