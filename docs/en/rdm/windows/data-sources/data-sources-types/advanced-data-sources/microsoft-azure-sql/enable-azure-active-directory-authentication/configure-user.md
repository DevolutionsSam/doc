If ***Microsoft*** is not available in the ***Authentication type*** drop-down list, verify that all steps in [this topic](/kb/remote-desktop-manager/how-to-articles/enable-sql-azure-ad-mfa/) have been completed.

4. In the ***Username*** field, enter the email of the user. 
{% snippet icon.badgeInfo %} 
The option ***Is guest/federated user*** next to the ***Domain*** field should only be enabled in rare and special cases where the account is guest or federated. If that is the case, you will be required to enter a full domain that should resemble this: azuresubscriptionprefix.onmicrosoft.com. 
{% endsnippet %}
 
5. Click ***OK*** when done. 
{% snippet icon.badgeCaution %} 
If you do not receive the MFA prompt, please verify your Azure logs in ***Authentications Details – Result detail*** . We currently have no way to force an MFA prompt on registered devices. If ***MFA requirement was skipped due to registered device*** appears, that is why in that case you are not getting the MFA prompt.
