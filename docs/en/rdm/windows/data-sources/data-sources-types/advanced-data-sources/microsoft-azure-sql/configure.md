title: Configure SQL Azure
---
1. Make sure that you have a valid Microsoft Azure SQL subscription to be able to create your database. 
1. Follow the steps in the [Create a data source](/rdm/windows/data-sources/create-new-data-source/) topic. On Step 4, after having configured the connection settings but before testing the server or otherwise verifying the connection, continue with the steps below. 
1. Select the ***Upgrade*** tab and click the ***Create Database*** button. If the database is already created on the Microsoft Azure SQL Server, click the ***Update Database*** button to add the appropriate tables to the database.

1. Once the database is created, create an administrator account for the database via the ***Administration â€“ User Management*** menu. 
{% snippet icon.badgeInfo %} 
If the database is created using a system administrator (example: SA), we recommend to keep this user only for the database creation and the [database upgrade](/rdm/windows/installation/database-upgrade/) . A {{ en.RDM }} administrator account must be created first. Then, regular users are created with this administrator account. 
{% endsnippet %}

5. Connect on the Microsoft Azure SQL database with the {{ en.RDM }} administrator account. To do so, edit the data source used to create the database and change the login information for the administrator account that you have created.

The Microsoft Azure SQL data source is now correctly configured.
