title: Encrypting Connections to SQL Server
---
To ensure that the communication between {{ en.RDM }} and the Microsoft SQL Server database is encrypted, an extensive procedure must be followed on the Microsoft SQL Server instance.  

Please consult this Microsoft technet article that provides detailed instructions: [Encrypting Connections to SQL Server (technet)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms189067(v=sql.105).aspx) .  

After it has been properly configured, the only modification to perform in {{ en.RDM }} is to set a property in the ***More Settings*** of the data source.  

## Procedure 

1. Create or edit an Microsoft SQL Server data source, access the ***Advanced*** tab and click the ***More Settings*** button.
