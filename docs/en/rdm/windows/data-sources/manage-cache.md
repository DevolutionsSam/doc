title: Manage Cache
---
This option allows you to manage your cache which decides how the client will re-load entries when changes are detected. On large data sources caching is a must and will increase performance significantly. 

{% snippet icon.badgeNotice %} 
This feature is only available when the offline engine is set to use SQLite. We are phasing out this engine because of multiple issues reported by customers. We recommend you use MCDFv2 .

Vacuum 
		</td>
		<td>
This will run an SQLite command to reduce your cache size. The Vacuum should only be used after trying to execute a Repair of your cache. If the repair hasn&apos;t solved your issue running a Vacuum will usually solve issues when dealing with a corrupted cache.

		<td>
Repair

The repair will run four different SQLite commands to repair a corrupted cache: 

* PRAGMA integrigy_check
