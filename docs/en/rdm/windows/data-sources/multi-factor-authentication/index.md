{% snippet icon.badgeInfo %} 
This feature is only available for [{{ en.RDMS }}](DataSource_RDMS) , [Microsoft Azure SQL](/rdm/windows/data-sources/data-sources-types/advanced-data-sources/microsoft-azure-sql/) , [Microsoft SQL Server](/rdm/windows/data-sources/data-sources-types/advanced-data-sources/microsoft-sql-server/) , and [SQLite](DataSource_SQLite) data sources.

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) identifies users by at least two different components: something that the user knows (often a password) and something that the user possesses (e.g., a validation code sent to a mobile device). If one of the components is missing or supplied incorrectly, the user&apos;s identity is not established with sufficient certainty and access to the data source will remain blocked.  

MFA is set at the data source level, except in {{ en.RDMS }} , where it is [set on the user](/server/web-interface/administration/configuration/server-settings/security/two-factor/) . {{ en.RDM }} supports [Authenticator (TOTP)](/rdm/windows/data-sources/multi-factor-authentication/authenticator-totp/) , [Yubikey](/rdm/windows/data-sources/multi-factor-authentication/yubikey/) , and [Duo](/rdm/windows/data-sources/multi-factor-authentication/duo/) .  

Go to the section that corresponds to you data source type:  

* [Azure SQL or SQL Server](#configure-multi-factor-authentication-on-a-microsoft-azure-sql-or-sql-server-sata-source) 
* [SQLite](#configure-multi-factor-authentication-on-a-sqlite-data-source) 

### Configure Multi-Factor Authentication on a Microsoft Azure SQL or SQL Server Sata Source 

1. In {{ en.RDM }} , go to the data source for which you want to configure the MFA. 
1. Go to ***File – My Account Settings*** . 
1. Click on ***Data Source MFA*** .
