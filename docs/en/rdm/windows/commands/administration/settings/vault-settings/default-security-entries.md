title: Default security for entries

In ***Administration – Settings –*** ***{{ en.VLT }}*** ***Settings*** , navigate to the ***Permissions*** tab. Under ***Inherited Permissions*** , change the ***Permission*** drop-down list to the desired setting:  

* ***Default (Inherited)*** : Allows users and roles that are assigned to a {{ en.VLT }} to see the content of that {{ en.VLT }} , but what they can do with it depends on how the permissions were set at the user level. 
* ***Custom*** : Allows to select specific users and user groups for each permission. 
* ***Never*** : Denies any access to all users, even if they have been given access to the {{ en.VLT }} . This can be used to set the permissions at the folder or entry level, for example.

To confirm the change, edit an entry below the {{ en.VLT }} and navigate to the ***Security – Permissions*** section. All permissions set to ***Default*** inherit the value from ***System Permissions*** or the user. Inherited values are displayed next to the permissions.
