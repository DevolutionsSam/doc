The ***Security Provider*** &#32; allows for encrypting the data source content. To access the security provider, navigate to Administration ***â€“*** Security Provider . 

{% snippet icon.badgeInfo %} 
This feature requires an [Advanced Data Source](/rdm/windows/data-sources/data-sources-types/advanced-data-sources/) . 
{% endsnippet %}
 
{% snippet icon.badgeInfo %} 
Regardless of the selected security provider, passwords stored in data sources are ALWAYS encrypted using AES 256 bit encryption. 
{% endsnippet %}
 
{% snippet icon.badgeHelp %} 
When configuring a Certificate Security Provider in a published app environment (Citrix, RemoteApp, XenApp) as a Security Provider, the user who will run {{ en.RDM }} in the RemoteApp environment (Citrix) will require a ***Read permission*** on the certificate.  

If the ***Read permission*** isn&apos;t correctly set, {{ en.RDM }} will generate the CryptographicException - Keyset does not exist error dialog. Follow the [Certificate Security Provider in a Published app Environment](/kb/remote-desktop-manager/how-to-articles/certificate-security-provider-published-app-environment/) topic to resolve the issue. 
{% endsnippet %}
 
{% snippet icon.shieldNotice %} 
By using a security provider, you ensure that nobody can read entries configuration data, even when people have a direct access to the database(s) or a backup. Shared data sources should always be secured with a security provider. 
{% endsnippet %}
 
{% snippet icon.shieldCaution %} 
Prior to applying a new or changing an existing security provider, make sure that every users are disconnected from the data source. If you are changing an existing Shared Passphrase or Certificate, please note that users will get back access to the data source when they the new Shared Passphrase or Certificate on their computer. 
{% endsnippet %}
 
## Settings 

{% snippet icon.badgeInfo %} 
Please note that changing a security provider on a data source with a great number of entries is a lengthy operation. 
{% endsnippet %}
 
{% snippet icon.badgeCaution %} 
Applying a new security provider does process the whole database, therefore we advise you to create a backup prior to this operation. 
{% endsnippet %}
 
1. Click on Change Security Settings to change the security provider.

## Shared Passphrase 

{% snippet icon.shieldWarning %} 
If the passphrase is lost, nothing that can be done to recover the data. When using a passphrase, always copy it to a secure location. 
{% endsnippet %}
 
![Security Provider - Shared Passphrase](/img/en/rdm/windows/clip3436.png) 

Entries configuration data is encrypted using a mix of a key stored in {{ en.RDM }} and the passphrase you&apos;ve entered.  

The passphrase is required only when configuring the data source. A policy can be enabled to always prompt for the passphrase when connecting to the data source.  

When configuring a security provider with a shared passphrase, you have the choice of whether or not you wish to save it in the registry. {{ en.RDM }} will try first to save it on the LOCAL_MACHINE, if unable it will save it in the CURRENT_USER instead.  

* HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\RemoteDesktopManager&lt;Datasource ID&gt;.shk 
* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\RemoteDesktopManager&lt;Datasource ID&gt;.shk 

If the option is not enabled, then the passphrase is saved locally at the following location:  

* %LOCALAPPDATA%\Devolutions\RemoteDesktopManager&lt;Datasource ID&gt;.shk 

In a Terminal Services environment, it should be saved at this location:  

* %APPDATA%\Devolutions\RemoteDesktopManager&lt;Datasource ID&gt;.shk 

In a portable installation of RDM, the passphrase will be saved at the same location as the portable {{ en.RDM }} instance. 

## Certificate 

When choosing ***Certificate*** as Security Provider, entries configuration data is encrypted using a mix of a key stored in {{ en.RDM }} and the private key contained in the certificate.
