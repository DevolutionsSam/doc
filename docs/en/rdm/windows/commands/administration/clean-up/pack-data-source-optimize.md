When holding a great number of entries in your data source it is a best practice to compress them to avoid slowness issues when using your data source. The ***Data Source (Optimize)*** will analyze all your entries, compress them and then re-saves them, thus saving space in your data source. 

## Settings 

1. Open the data source you wish to optimize. In ***Administration*** , click on ***Pack Data Source (Optimize)***   and then click on ***Analyze*** .
