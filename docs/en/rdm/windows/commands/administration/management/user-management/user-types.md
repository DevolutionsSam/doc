### Rights 

When setting a user to the ***Restricted User*** type, rights must be granted manually. These rights have an immediate influence on which actions the user can perform on unsecured entries. Therefore, rights must be granted for users to be able to perform actions on entries, as permissions cannot override the absence of right.  

Once rights are granted, they can be restricted with the [User Groups Based Security](/rdm/windows/user-groups-based-access-control/) or Security Groups.  

The ***Add*** right also displays the ***Add in*** ***{{ en.VLT }}*** option. This must be enable for users to be able to add entries into the {{ en.VLT }} folder of the data source.
