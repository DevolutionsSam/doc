{% youtube 'rYYkfgdeY5E' %}  

User Groups in {{ en.RDM }} manages multiple users at the same time by grouping them. The management of permissions granted to user groups are quite similar to the corresponding notions for users, but instead of a single user, they apply to all users to which you&apos;ve assigned the user groups.

### User Groups in {{ en.RDMS }} 

User Groups in {{ en.RDMS }} are in fact links to Active Directory groups. By leveraging Active Directory integration you can easily define access rights for all domain users in your organization. Once a domain user log in the {{ en.RDMS }} data source, their user account will be created if needed and users rights will be controlled by the defined groups.  

{% snippet icon.shieldWarning %} 
Please note that the Unsecured group permissions (the ones above the grid) are ignored. You must set them on each user individually.
