Toggle the data source [Offline Mode](/rdm/windows/data-sources/offline-mode/) .  

Use the offline mode to connect to a local copy of the data source when the remote database is unavailable. This is useful when working from a remote location and the network is unreachable or if there is any kind of connectivity issue.

The offline mode availability relies on several settings, refer to the [Offline Mode](/rdm/windows/data-sources/offline-mode/) topic.  

The lowest setting (in terms of security) prevails over the others, which may prevent you from using the offline mode. If the ***Go Offline*** button is not available, please consult your administrator.  

The ***Data Source Information*** displays the size of the offline cache file along with the effective modes (disabled, read-only or read/write).
