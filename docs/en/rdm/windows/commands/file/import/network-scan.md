title: Import with Network Scan
---
***Import with Network Scan*** allows you to perform a network scan based on a predefined range of IP addresses to find sessions to import.  

Once the scan is completed, select the sessions you wish to import (by default, all sessions are selected), and click ***OK*** to import the sessions in your data source. 

{% snippet icon.badgeCaution %} 
If you wish to review each and every session as they are imported, you can check the ***Edit imported entry*** option. However, this is not recommend for a large number of sessions.
