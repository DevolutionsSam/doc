SSH keys provide a secure way of logging into a virtual private server with SSH than using a password alone. While a password can eventually be cracked with a brute force attack, SSH keys are nearly impossible to decipher by brute force alone.

DSA : It is faster in signing but slower in verifying. It can only be used for signing/verification it does not encrypt/decrypt . When using DSA it is a recommended to use a 1024 bits key size.

{% snippet icon.badgeCaution %} 
If using the [Key Agent Manager](/rdm/windows/commands/tools/tools/key-agent-manager/) you must chose the PuTTY Private Key (.ppk) file format or the OpenSSH Private Key (.pri) file format. The PKCS Private Key is not a supported file format for the Key Agent Manager.
