{% snippet icon.badgeInfo %} 
The information in this topic is how the &quot;Legacy&quot; mode of password analysis works. The mode can be changed in the System Settings for ZXCVBN . The &quot;Legacy&quot; mode is not the default mode.

The ***Entry Security Analyzer*** evaluates the strength of passwords stored in the data source. To access the password analyzer, navigate the Tools tab.  

A strenght password control is also displayed under most password fields of entries.

The ***Entry Security Analyzer*** follows a set of rules to determine the strength of the password with a score from 0 to 100. There are two categories of rules. 

### Reinforce 

These are the rules which make the passwords stronger:  

* The password length 
* The number of uppercase letters (A-Z) 
* The number of lowercase letters (a-z) 
* The number of digits (0-9) 
* The number of symbols (!, @, #, $, etc.) 
* The number of digits or symbols in the middle of the password 
* Three or more of the rules above are met 

The minimum requirements for a Strong password are:  

* The password is at least 5 characters long 
* The password contains uppercase and lowercase characters 
* The password contains digits 

### Weakening 

These are the rules which make the passwords weaker:  

* The password contains only letters 
* The password contains only digits 
* The password has repeated characters 
* The password has consecutive uppercase letters (two or more) 
* The password has consecutive lowercase letters (two or more) 
* The password has consecutive digits (two or more) 
* The password has sequential letters (ABCD, DCBA) 
* The password has sequential digits (1234, 4321)
