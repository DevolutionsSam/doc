title: Specific Settings
---
***Specific Settings*** are used to override the properties of an entry. Several settings can be overridden, such as the credentials or the display mode. There are two types of ***Specific Settings*** : user specific settings and local machine specific settings.  

* ***User Specific Settings*** override an entry&apos;s properties for a single user. 
* ***Local Specific Settings*** override an entry&apos;s properties for all users of a specific device.

This feature is only available when using an [Advanced Data Source](/rdm/windows/data-sources/data-sources-types/advanced-data-sources/) . A setting on the data source allows usage of ***Specific Settings*** . Contact your administrator if the menu is grayed out.
