***{{ en.VLT }}*** are containers for your entries, your credentials, sensitive information, sessions, and more.

You will start with two vaults:  

* One main default ***{{ en.VLT }}*** created for sharing entries to team members that you grant access to. You can add and share more vaults in ***Administration – Vaults*** . 
* One ***{{ en.PVLT }}*** , which is user-centric and is used to store information such as personal account credentials. The ***{{ en.PVLT }}*** prevents users from using a non-secured tool to manage their personal passwords at work. The ***{{ en.PVLT }}*** can be disabled in ***Administration – System Settings – User Vault*** . 

The two vault types can also be found in the ***{{ en.NPANE }}*** menu.
