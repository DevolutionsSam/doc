### Criteria Types 

The following criteria are available to refine your search: ***Connection type*** , ***Creation date*** , ***Description*** , ***Folder*** , ***Last update date*** and ***Name*** .

At least one criterion must be used to filter your results, and a maximum of four criteria can be applied at once.

Drop-down lists will appear when selecting certain criteria to give you more search options.

### Results Display 

The results are displayed when the ***Search*** button is pressed. Once done, the name of all entries and folders and the vault in which they are located are shown in the results field. The paths to entries or folders are also displayed above each result or result group.  
![Search Button](/img/en/rdm/windows/RDMWin2011.png) 

It is possible to select multiple entries at once by shift-clicking or all of them with the Ctrl+A shortcut. Right-clicking one or more entries shows the same menu and options as the ***{{ en.NPANE }}*** . 

### Other functions 

The ***Select in*** ***{{ en.NPANE }}*** button, when pressed, takes you directly to the selected entry or folder in the corresponding vault's ***{{ en.NPANE }}*** .  

The ***Reset*** button clears all your search results and options, giving you a clean slate for a new search.
