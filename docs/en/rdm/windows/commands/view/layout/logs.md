The ***Logs*** feature is similar to [***Activity Logs***](/rdm/windows/commands/view/view/activity-logs/) , but it only provides information about the selected entry. Logs are available from the context menu ***View – Layout – Logs*** .

## Functions 

The log entries can be filtered by ***Date*** or by using a custom time period, specifying whether it is ***Local Time*** or ***UTC Time*** .  

It is also possible to enable the ***Show live sesison only (auto refresh)*** and ***Show user specific settings logs*** options by checking the appropriate box.

### Generate a Report 

![Generate Report](/img/en/rdm/windows/RDMWin2032.png) 

Clicking on the ***Generate report*** button opens a window that allows you to generate a report of the logs while specifying the time period, the type of time ( ***Local Time*** or ***UTC Time*** ), and, optionally, an ***On open comment*** , an ***On close comment*** , and a ***Message*** . When finished, clicking the ***OK*** button generates a report that can be saved, exported (in CSV, HTML, Xlsx, or XML format), or printed.

## Logs 

The log contains all CRUD operations (add, edit, and delete), displayed passwords, used credentials, etc. It is possible to right-click on an entry to access more options.

The information about entries is the same as in [***Activity Logs***](/rdm/windows/commands/view/view/activity-logs/) , except that ***Folder*** , ***Connection*** , ***Vault*** , and ***Connection Log ID*** are not available in ***Logs*** since the information is specific to an entry only. For a description of the available information, see the ***Activity Logs*** topic.
