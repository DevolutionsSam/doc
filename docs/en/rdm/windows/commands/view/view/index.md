### Quick Connect 

The ***Quick Connect*** feature allows you to open an ad-hoc session by specifying the host and session type. For more information, visit our [***Quick Connect***](/rdm/windows/commands/view/view/quick-connect/) topic. 

### Activity Logs 

The ***Activity Logs*** feature opens a tab containing information about user activity in the selected data source. For more information, visit our [***Activity Logs***](/rdm/windows/commands/view/view/activity-logs/) topic. 

### Lists 

Multiple list types are available in the ***View*** section: ***Credential List*** , ***Macros/Scripts/Tools List*** , ***Synchronizer List*** , and ***VPN List*** . These options open a window showing a tree view of all entries of the specific entry type in the database. The lists can be filtered using the search bar. Right-clicking on an item shows the same menu and options as in the ***{{ en.NPANE }}*** .

### Tab Groups 

The ***Tab Groups*** feature opens a docked window showing a tree view of the various tab groups. It is possible to select multiple tabs at once by shift-clicking or all of them with the Ctrl+A shortcut. Right-clicking on one or more tabs shows more options.  

The other ***Tab groups*** will only appear if a session that is part of a tab group (other than the ***All*** tab) is active.

Although it is docked by default, the ***Tab Groups*** pane can be windowed, dragged, and docked anywhere within {{ en.RDM }} .  

To learn how to create a tab group, refer to our [***Grouped Tab Bar***](/rdm/windows/commands/view/layout/grouped-tab-bar/) topic. 

### Notification 

The ***Notification*** feature opens a window showing the various notifications (such as expired or about to be expired entries or tasks). Right-clicking on a notification shows more options. If you double-click on an "expired license" notification, a browser page opens to take you to your {{ en.RDMS }} account. Notifications can be sorted or searched by ***Text*** , ***Source*** , ***Folder*** , ***Level*** , ***Type*** , ***Date*** , ***Time*** , or ***Days*** .
