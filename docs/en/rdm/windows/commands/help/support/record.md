If you are experiencing issues with {{ en.RDM }} , you can help our Devolutions Support team troubleshoot the problem by sending them a short video of your issue. Launch this by using the ***Record*** feature located in the menu Help   â€“   Record.  

The   ***Record*** is an easy-to-use built-in screen recorder that could even be a useful for your in-house training as it is not limited to {{ en.RDM }} . 

## Settings 

The Video Recording Options uses the MP4 format, which on Vanilla installs of Windows is not supported. If you encounter any difficulty viewing the video we strongly suggest the use of a [VLC player](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html) .
