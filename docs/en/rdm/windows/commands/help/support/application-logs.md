When encountering errors, you can verify the local application log, which is available in Help – Application Logs .  

These logs are saved in %LocalAppData%\Devolutions\RemoteDesktopManager\RemoteDesktopManager.log.db . Logs are displayed as a list which can be filtered by date, message, version,or type of log.

### Clean up 

For security reason, it is a best practice is to clean up the application log once every month. To do so, in the application log, use the ***Clean Up*** feature.  

We strongly recommend to do a ***Delete all*** , but this can be customized to delete specific logs by type, date or selection.

### Increasing the Debug level 

When experiencing issues with {{ en.RDM }} our support team might ask you to increase the debug level of the application during the support process. We strongly suggest to only increase the debug level when requested by our support team.  

Increase the debug level in ***File – Options – Advanced*** .
