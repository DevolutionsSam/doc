title: Database Upgrade
---
This topic applies to installations with data sources that are using a database as their data store.  

Some {{ en.RDM }} releases must alter the database structure. These are performed automatically for you but it is best practice to perform a backup of your data source beforehand. Additionally, If you are in a team environment you must be the sole user connected to the database during the upgrade.

1. You may be prompted with an upgrade message when your data source is accessed. If so accept the upgrade.

Using File â€“ Data sources , locate your data source to upgrade and open its property window. Switch to the Upgrade tab, then click on Update Database  

6. Wait for a confirmation dialog. 
1. Close the dialog. 
1. Ensure your {{ en.RDM }} application is currently using that data source.
