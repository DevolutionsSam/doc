When using an [Advanced Data Source](/rdm/windows/data-sources/data-sources-types/advanced-data-sources/) , there is no need to register {{ en.RDM }} since the license serial is stored in the data source and retrieved directly from it. When launching the application for the first time, simply [add the data source](/rdm/windows/data-sources/create-new-data-source/) containing the serial. 

{% snippet icon.badgeCaution %} 
The license menu to register {{ en.RDM }} is available for SQLite and {{ en.PHUB }} Personal, but not for other individual data sources. 
{% endsnippet %}
 
{% snippet icon.badgeInfo %} 
It is possible to [request a trial](/rdm/windows/installation/client/registration/trial-request/) to try {{ en.RDM }} Team for 30 days. If you decide not to register the application with a Team Edition license serial at the end of the 30-day period, your data will not be altered or erased, and you will have full access to it once you provide a license serial.
