To install a single portable {{ en.RDM }} application, follow this topic: [Portable RDM Installation](/kb/remote-desktop-manager/how-to-articles/portable-rdm-installation/) . 
{% endsnippet %}
 
{% snippet icon.badgeWarning %} 
This procedure is not recommended for running {{ en.RDM }} from a network shared by multiple users. This would prevent identifying individual users and there would be conflicts with user preferences. 
{% endsnippet %}
 
{% snippet icon.badgeNotice %} 
{{ en.RDM }} stores the offline cache in your Windows profile by default. If you are using an Advanced Data Source and plan to use the offline mode, go to ***File - Options - Advanced*** and check ***Use application directory for offline cache*** to have the offline cached stored in the application folder instead.
