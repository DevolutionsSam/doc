{{ en.RDM }} saves its configuration in a file named RemoteDesktopManager.cfg. This file contains most of the application settings. 

{% snippet icon.badgeInfo %} 
You can retrieve the installation folder of {{ en.RDM }} by clicking File – Options – Advanced . A hyperlink displays the installation folder.

The configuration file can be located in different folders depending on certain conditions: 

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>

CASE 
		</th>
		<th>
CONFIGURATION FILE LOCATION 
		</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
Installed under "Program Files" or "Program Files (x86)" 
		</td>
		<td>
```%LocalAppData%\Devolutions\RemoteDesktopManager```
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
Application running on Terminal Server 
		</td>
		<td>
```%AppData%\Devolutions\RemoteDesktopManager```  

This is the roaming profile and avoids multi-user conflicts.

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
Other 
		</td>
		<td>
Installation folder 
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>

## Override the Default Path 

There are two ways to change the folder where the configuration file is stored:  

1. Create a file named " Override.cfg" in the application folder. {{ en.RDM }} opens this file and reads the first line. It should contain the desired installation folder (without the file name). If you wish to use the current installation path, put a period in the file. Here are a few examples:  

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>

EXAMPLES 
		</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
c:\RDM 
		</td>
		<td>
The config file is saved in the designated folder. 
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
. 
		</td>
		<td>
The period is used to specify the {{ en.RDM }} installation folder. 
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
%AppData%\Devolutions\RemoteDesktopManager 
		</td>
		<td>
Specify the application roaming data folder. 
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>

2. By adding a key in the registry: CurrentUser\SOFTWARE\RemoteDesktopManager, OptionPath . Set the desired path in the key OptionPath . You must not include the file name in the value, just the path.
