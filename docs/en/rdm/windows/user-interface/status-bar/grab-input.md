title: Grab Input
---
The ***grab keyboard input*** is used to capture the keyboard shortcuts when a session is running. It can be disabled momentarily to ensure that the shortcut is sent to the running session.  

Ctrl+F is a shortcut that often interferes. It is used to focus {{ en.RDM }} 's search/filter toolbar. However, it is almost always present in applications in the remote session and when you use the shortcut, {{ en.RDM }} sets the focus in the search/filter toolbar instead. This conflict can be avoided by disabling the feature.
