{% snippet icon.badgeInfo %} 
If a temporary access request was made in {{ en.RDM }} from a {{ en.PHUB }} database, the authorization process must be performed in {{ en.PHUB }} . See our [Grant Temporary Access to an Entry in {{ en.PHUB }} Business](/hub/web-interface/hub-overview/temporary-access-hub-business/grant-temporary-access-to-an-entry/) topic.

The ***Temporary Access*** feature allows users to request a temporary elevation of their permissions for a specific entry. The authorizer must then approve or deny the request. 

{% snippet icon.badgeInfo %} 
When using {{ en.RDMS }} , Microsoft SQL Server or Microsoft Azure SQL data sources, you must first [Enable Temporary Access](/kb/remote-desktop-manager/how-to-articles/enable-temporary-access/) in {{ en.RDM }} . 
{% endsnippet %}
 
To learn how to view your past and current requests, go to the [View Temporary Access Requests](#view-temporary-access-requests) section.   

To learn how to respond to a request, go to the [Approve/Deny Temporary Access Requests](#approvedeny-temporary-access-requests) section.  

### View Temporary Access Requests 

To view all your past and current requests, you must use the following ***Pending Access Requests*** box to open the ***Temporary Access Requests*** window.  
![Dashboard â€“ Pending Access Requests](/img/en/rdm/windows/RDMWin2072.png) 

In the ***Temporary Access Requests*** window, you can see all your temporary access requests and sort them by ***Status*** , ***Username*** , ***Data source user*** , ***Entry*** , ***Action*** , ***Date*** , ***Request duration*** , ***Authorized duration*** , ***Authorizer username*** , or ***Authorizer data source user*** .  
![Show Temporary Access Requests](/img/en/rdm/windows/RDMWin2074.png) 

It is also possible to display only certain requests with the ***Status*** drop-down menu or with the filter bar at the top.  

Using the ***View messages*** button, you can view the ***Request message*** and the ***Authorization message*** of a specific request.  
![Request Messages](/img/en/rdm/windows/RDMWin2076.png) 

Finally, clicking on the ***Approve*** and ***Deny*** buttons open the ***Temporary Access Response*** window, which is described in the [next section](#approvedeny-temporary-access-requests) . 

### Approve/Deny Temporary Access Requests 

{% snippet icon.badgeInfo %} 
When using Microsoft SQL Server or Microsoft Azure SQL data sources, if you want users to automatically receive an email notifying them of your response, you must first [Enable Temporary Access Notifications](/kb/remote-desktop-manager/how-to-articles/enable-temporary-access/) in {{ en.RDM }} . 
{% endsnippet %}
 

To respond to a request, you need to open the ***Temporary Access Response*** window. There are two ways to access it.  

The first option is to use the ***Pending Access Requests*** box (see image below) in the ***Overview*** tab of your ***Dashboard*** . Clicking on either the green check mark (approve the request) or the red "X" (deny the request) next to a request will open the ***Temporary Access Response*** window.  
![Pending Access Requests](/img/en/rdm/windows/RDMWin2077.png) 

The second option requires you to go through the other ***Pending Access Requests*** box described in the [previous section](#view-temporary-access-requests) . Whatever way you choose to access the response window, the result will be the same.

This view is divided into two sections: 

* The ***Request Info*** section contains information about the user's request. Because this was done on the user's side, fields in this section cannot be edited. 
* The ***Response Parameters*** section allows you to change the temporary access duration specified by the user. It is also possible to write a message to the user explaining your decision, but it remains optional. 

Clicking on the ***Send response*** button will approve or deny the request, depending on what you selected earlier. A confirmation window will pop up which you can make disappear by clicking on ***OK*** .
