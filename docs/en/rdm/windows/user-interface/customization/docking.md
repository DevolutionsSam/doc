title: Docking
---
Customizable styles (default ***Ribbon*** and default ***Menu*** ) have dockable panes that can be rearranged to your liking. Simply left-click then drag the sub-components to reveal drop zones. This allows you to drop the sub-component anywhere you want, even outside of the main form if you wish.

Panes can also be docked into another dockable pane using the same drag & drop method. In the following example, the ***{{ en.NPANE }}*** is dropped in the ***Description*** pane.
