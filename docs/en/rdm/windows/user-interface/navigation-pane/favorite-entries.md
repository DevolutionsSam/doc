title: Favorite Entries
---
The ***Favorites*** tab contains entries flagged as favorite by the current user. Favorites are not shared and they roam with the user profile.  

This is useful when the number of managed entries becomes too great or when a strict directory structure must be maintained.

The favorites view can be personalized to show the sub-connections. Click on the ellipsis and select ***Show Sub Entries*** . You can also ***Import*** and ***Export*** favorites by clicking on the corresponding option.  

A shortcut to the ***Favorites*** tab of the ***{{ en.NPANE }}*** is located in the ***Panels*** section of the ***View*** tab.

### Organize the favorites 

Favorites do not necessarily replicate the folder structure of the ***{{ en.VLT }}*** . Add folders in the favorite view to organize your favorite entries.

### Icon overlay 

If desired, an icon overlay blue star can be displayed in the ***{{ en.VLT }}*** over favorite entries. To display the icon overlay, navigate to ***File – Options – User Interface – Favorites*** , then enable the ***Show favorite icon in navigation tree*** option.
