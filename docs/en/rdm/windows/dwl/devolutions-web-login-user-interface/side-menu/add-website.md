The ***Add Website*** button is only available while in the [***Matching***](/rdm/windows/dwl/devolutions-web-login-user-interface/side-menu/) tab, which is the tab selected when opening the extension. It opens a new tab in your browser that allows you to add a website entry in {{ en.RDM }} through {{ en.DWL }} .  

When {{ en.RDM }} is used as the data source, the entry configuration is done in the ***General*** tab.
