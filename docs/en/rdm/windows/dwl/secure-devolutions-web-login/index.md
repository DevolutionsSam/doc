In {{ en.RDM }} versions 2021.1 and above, we changed how our browser extension {{ en.DWL }} communicates with {{ en.RDM }} to fill in credentials inside web pages. We made these changes to increase the security of this feature. Visit the [First Login](/rdm/windows/dwl/first-login-devolutions-web-login/) topic for the setup steps. 
{% snippet icon.shieldWarning %} 
If you are using a version below 2021.1, as mentioned in the [{{ en.DWL }} Overview](/rdm/windows/dwl/overview/) topic, installing the extension in a Remote Desktop Services (Terminal Services) environment can introduce security risks. In such environments, each user must have a distinct port assigned as well as an application key to prevent any other {{ en.DWL }} from listening in.  

If you insist on using these older versions, it is critical that each user be assigned a distinct port. An application key must be set as well. The first client application that starts will be able to use the port exclusively. ALL {{ en.DWL }} calling on that port will get the responses unless an application key is set. Continue to the [following section](#how-to-set-up--endwl--for-versions-below-20211-and-for-remote-desktop-servers) for the setup steps.
