Devolutions Web Login is a web browser password plugin used in conjunction with Remote Desktop Manager, Devolutions Server and Devolutions Password Hub, which allows users to securely inject passwords into websites using credentials stored in their Vaults.

It gives system administrators full control over the management of passwords, without affecting the user's productivity.
