Before using your application, you will have to complete a quick setup that involves selecting your Devolutions product(s), connecting to your {{ en.DA }}, and configuring some security settings.

## {{ en.WS }} Setup

Follow the steps below to perform the initial configuration of your {{ en.WS }} mobile application with {{ en.PHUBP }}:

1. [Download and install {{ en.WS }}](https://devolutions.net/workspace/) if you have not already done so.
1. After the installation is complete, open the application.
1. In the ***Workspace Setup***, check ***{{ en.HUB }} Personal***, then tap on ***Start Setup***.

During the setup, you can always tap on ***Skip This Step*** to configure that specific setting later.
{% endsnippet %}

3. If you do not have a {{ en.DA }}, tap on ***Create an account*** and follow the steps to create your account. If you do have an account, tap on ***Login*** to authenticate.

1. Back to the {{ en.WS }} setup, choose to either back up your entries on {{ en.HUB }} Personal or not back them up. Backing up your entries on {{ en.HUB }} Personal is recommended as you will be able to access them from any device.

1. Tap ***Next***.
1. Optionally, enable the use of a ***Biometric lock*** (Touch/Face ID). It is a recommended practice. Your device will prompt you to authenticate using this method. It must first be configured on your device to work with {{ en.WS }}.
