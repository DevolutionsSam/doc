Website entries can be created with {{ en.DWL }} in {{ en.HUB }} Business. This type of entry is useful for saving your login credentials so that you do not have to remember them. These entries are also used by {{ en.DWL }} to recognize a website and [retrieve your credentials](/hub/dwl/using-devolutions-web-login/using-dwl-with-hub-business/retrieve-credentials-hub-business/) .  

The main way to achieve this is by successfully logging into the website. {{ en.DWL }} will automatically offer to save your credentials in a new website entry in {{ en.HUB }} Business. It is also possible to manually create the website entry.  

Learn how to add a website entry by following the instructions from these sections:

1. Select the ***Vault*** and ***Folder*** in which to save your website entry. 
1. Click ***Save*** .  

Your credentials are now securely stored in a new website entry in {{ en.PHUB }} Business.
