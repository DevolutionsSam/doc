---
Website, credit card, contact, and secure note entries can be created with {{ en.DWL }} in {{ en.HUB }} Personal. To add a website entry, continue to the [next section](#add-a-website-entry) . For all other types of entries, go to [this section](#add-another-type-of-entry) instead.  

## Add a Website Entry 

{% snippet icon.badgeInfo %} 
This section explains how to create an entry with your existing website credentials. If you have not yet created an account for the website, follow the instructions in [this topic](/hub/dwl/using-devolutions-web-login/using-dwl-with-hub-personal/create-account-website-hub-personal/) instead. 
{% endsnippet %}
 
The website entry is useful for saving your login credentials so that you do not have to remember them. These entries are also used by {{ en.DWL }} to recognize a website and [retrieve your credentials](/hub/dwl/using-devolutions-web-login/using-dwl-with-hub-personal/retrieve-credentials-hub-personal/) .  

The main way to achieve this is by successfully logging into the website. {{ en.DWL }} will automatically offer to save your credentials in a new website entry in {{ en.HUB }} Personal. It is also possible to manually create the website entry.  

Learn how to add a website entry by following the instructions from these sections:  

* [Automatically Add a Website Entry](#automatically-add-a-website-entry) 
* [Manually Add a Website Entry](#manually-add-a-website-entry)
