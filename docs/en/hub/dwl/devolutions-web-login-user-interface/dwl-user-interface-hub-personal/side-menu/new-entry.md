The ***New Entry*** button is only available while in the [***Matching***](/hub/dwl/devolutions-web-login-user-interface/dwl-user-interface-hub-personal/side-menu/#matching-tab) tab, which is the tab selected when opening the extension, or when browsing through the entries of the [***All Entries***](/hub/dwl/devolutions-web-login-user-interface/dwl-user-interface-hub-personal/side-menu/#all-entries-tab) tab. You can choose to create a new ***Website*** , ***Credit Card*** , ***Contact*** , or ***Secure Note*** entry.  
![New Entry Type Selection](/img/en/hub/Hub2134.png) 

When the entry type is selected, a new tab opens in your browser that allows you to add an entry of that type in {{ en.PHUB }} Personal through {{ en.DWL }} .  

When {{ en.PHUB }} Personal is used as the data source, the basic entry configuration is done in the ***General*** tab, but other parameters are also available in other tabs. Below is an example of the ***General*** tab settings when creating a website entry.
