### Vaults tab 

{% snippet icon.badgeHelp %} 
When accessing the ***Vaults*** tab for the first time, you need to select the {{ en.PHUB }} Business vaults you want to synchronize with {{ en.DWL }} . Learn more about it in our [First Login with {{ en.DWL }}](/hub/dwl/first-login-devolutions-web-login/hub-business/) topic. 
{% endsnippet %}
 
The ***Vaults*** tab allows you to browse through all your synchronized vaults for your entries.  
![Vaults Tab](/img/en/hub/Hub2119.png) 

At the top, you can use the ***Filter*** bar to search through all your vaults for entries.  

To access a vault in {{ en.DWL }} , click on it and navigate through the folders to manually find the entry you are looking for. The folder structure is identical to that of your {{ en.PHUB }} Business.  

When navigating in the folders, the [***Add Website***](/hub/dwl/devolutions-web-login-user-interface/dwl-user-interface-hub-business/side-menu/add-website/)button will appear at the bottom of the ***Content Area*** .  

### User vault tab 

The ***User vault*** tab works the same way as the ***Vaults*** tab, except that you navigate through your ***User vault*** instead of your other vaults. You also do not have to select vaults to synchronize as the only vault available in this tab is your own ***User vault*** .

At the top, you can use the ***Filter*** bar to search through all your folders and entries.  

To access an entry in {{ en.DWL }} , navigate through the folders to manually find the entry you are looking for. The folder structure is identical to that of your {{ en.PHUB }} Business.  

When navigating in the folders, the [***Add Website***](/hub/dwl/devolutions-web-login-user-interface/dwl-user-interface-hub-business/side-menu/add-website/) button will appear at the bottom of the ***Content Area*** .  

### Password Generator tab 

The ***Password Generator*** tab assists you in creating a strong and secure password adapted to your needs and to website requirements for your new account.

Your custom password is generated at the top of the ***Content Area*** with a strenght indicator below it. You can copy it or generate a new one using the ***Copy to Clipboard*** and ***Generate Password*** buttons respectively. The ***Password lenght*** , which is set to 12 by default, can also be adjusted.  

In the ***General*** drop-down section, you are able to select the types of characters that your password must contain as well as the minimum number of characters of each type that must be included.

In the ***Advanced*** drop-down section, you are able to further customize your password by entering characters you want included in your password, followed by the minimum number of times they must appear. In the second field, you can also enter characters you want excluded from your password.

![Copy Username, Copy Password, and View options](/img/en/hub/Hub2116.png) 

The ***Copy Username*** and ***Copy Password*** buttons copy the username/password of the entry to your clipboard.  

The ***View*** button gives you an overview of the entry as well as additional functionalities. The availability of information and functionalities depends on the type of entry and the information provided in the entry, although some of them are always available:  

* ***Edit*** / ***Delete*** the entry with the ellipses button at the top right. 
* View the location of your entry under the ***Vault*** and ***Folder*** (if it is located under a folder) sections. 
* See when the entry was last modified and created under the ***Last Modified On*** and ***Created on*** sections respectively.  

Other information and functionalities will depend on what you provided when creating the entry (username, password, tags, description, etc.).
