The ***Roles*** list is set with default permissions, but can be personalized with the ***Customs*** option. Click the ***View Roles Definition*** button to choose from the list. You can also visit our [Roles and Permissions](/hub/web-interface/hub-overview/administration/configuration-security/system-permissions/roles-permissions/) topic.
