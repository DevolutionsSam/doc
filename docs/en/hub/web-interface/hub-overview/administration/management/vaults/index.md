title: Vaults
---
***Vaults*** are containers for your entries, your credentials, sensitive information, sessions, and more.  

You will start with two:  

* One main ***Default Vault*** created for sharing entries to team members that you grant access to. You can add and share more vaults in ***Administration – Vaults*** .  
* One ***User Vault*** , which is user centric and is used to store information such as personal account credentials. The ***User Vault*** prevents users from using a non-secure tool to manage their personal passwords at work. The ***User Vault*** can be disabled in ***Administration – System Settings*** .
