{% snippet icon.shieldCaution %} 
By default, a newly created ***Application User*** has no permissions. See the next section to assign permissions. 
{% endsnippet %}
 
### Assign Permissions 

Depending on the actions that this application user needs to perform, you need to assign it the proper rights:  

* [Assign application user system permissions](/hub/web-interface/hub-overview/administration/configuration-security/system-permissions/) 
* [Assign application user vault permissions](/hub/web-interface/hub-overview/administration/management/vaults/create-manage-vaults/)  

When permissions have been assigned, you are ready to access {{ en.PHUB }} with the [Hub PowerShell Module](/hub/powershell-module/) and your application user.
