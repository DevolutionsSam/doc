This step will validate if the user has a {{ en.DA }} .  

* If yes, it will link the account to the {{ en.PHUB }} .  
* If not, it will automatically create a {{ en.DA }} with a ***Temporary Password*** , which you can choose how to handle. You can manage how ***Temporary Passwords*** are handled in ***Administration – System Settings – General*** .
