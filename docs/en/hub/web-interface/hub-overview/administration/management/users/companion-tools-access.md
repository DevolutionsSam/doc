title: Companion Tools Access
---
As an administrator to your {{ en.PHUB }} Business, you can disable or enable the use of companion tools for specific users that are not administrators.  

{% snippet icon.badgeNotice %} 
To reduce the number of inquiries from your users, we recommend that you inform them before changing their access to {{ en.PHUB }} via their companion tool(s), especially if you disable their access. 
{% endsnippet %}
 
These settings can be configured in ***Administration â€“ Users*** when [creating and inviting a user](Web_Interface_Administration_User_Invite) or after the fact by editing the user. This only affects the user for whom the settings have been changed.  

Access to companion tools can be configured separately for {{ en.DWL }} and Devolutions Workspace. The settings are enabled by default.
