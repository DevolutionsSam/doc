This video includes information pertaining to both requesters and authorizers. A user wanting to request temporary access to an entry may find this visual aid useful, but watching the video is not essential since all the steps are described in this topic.  

To learn how to approve or deny a request, visit our [Grant Temporary Access to an Entry in {{ en.PHUB }} Business](/hub/web-interface/hub-overview/temporary-access-hub-business/grant-temporary-access-to-an-entry/) topic.

The ***Temporary Access*** feature allows users to request a temporary elevation of their permissions for a specific entry. The authorizer must then approve or deny the request.  

### Request Temporary Access 

Follow the steps below to learn how to make a temporary access request: 

1. In the ***{{ en.VLT }}*** tab, select the entry you want access to in the vault of your choice. 
1. Click on the ***More*** button, then select ***Temporary Access Request*** .

Hovering your mouse over the eye icon while you have a ***Permissions*** level selected lets you see what permissions it includes. For example, the following image shows the permissions for the ***Operators*** role.

To help you decide which role to select, you can visit our [Roles and Permissions](/hub/web-interface/hub-overview/administration/configuration-security/system-permissions/roles-permissions/) topic.  
5. Select the authorizer you want to send your request to using the drop-down menu. You can also use the filter bar to refine your research.

1. Write a short ***Message*** to the authorizer explaining why you want access to this entry. This is optional, but we strongly recommend it as it allows the authorizer to make a more informed decision. When you are done, click on ***Send Request*** .  

You now have to wait for the authorizer to respond to your request. You will be notified by email whether the answer is positive or negative. The next section details what to do once you have received a response. 

### Response to your request 

If the authorizer approves your request, your email will have a button at the bottom that will bring you directly to your entry in {{ en.PHUB }} Business. It is also possible to manually go to your entry.

Once you are on the entry in the {{ en.VLT }} , you will see a ***Temporary Access Request*** section near the top. A check mark validates that your request was approved. Next to the check mark is the ***Time remaining*** on your request. There is also a ***View Details*** button which is described in the next section .  

You can now perform your task with this elevated permission.

### View Details and Revoke your Temporary Access 

The ***View Details*** button allows you to see information about your ***Temporary Access Request*** as well as revoke your access.  

In the top section, you can see the ***Permissions*** level granted by the authorizer, the ***Requested duration*** , the ***Authorized duration*** , and the ***Time remaining*** on your temporary access.  

Further down, you can read the message you sent to the authorizer when you created your request as well as the approval message they sent back.  

Finally, for any reason, you may revoke your temporary access by clicking on the ***Revoke*** button. Be sure you want to do this first, since in order to regain access to your entry, you will need to make another request. Otherwise, your access will end within the time frame set by you and the authorizer.
