Exporting and importing data from and to {{ en.PHUB }} Personal is done differently than in {{ en.PHUB }} Business. Refer to [this topic](/kb/password-hub/how-to-articles/import-export-data-hub-personal/) if you are using {{ en.PHUB }} Personal. 
{% endsnippet %}
 
In the {{ en.PHUB }} Business ***Tools*** tab, you can find under the ***Export*** section the ***Export with PowerShell*** feature. It allows you to export your {{ en.PHUB }} Business data in the Json or Csv format using a PowerShell script.

You will first need to create an application user with the ***Manager*** role.  

Once done, you have the choice to automatically or manually fill in your information in the PowerShell script. Whichever option you choose, you will need access to your ***Application Secret*** and your ***Application key*** and to know the ***Destination folder path*** .
