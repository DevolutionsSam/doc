Administrators must have the email address of the user they wish to invite. See the invitation steps in our [Create and Invite Users](/hub/web-interface/hub-overview/administration/management/users/create-invite-users/) topic. 
For an overview of the end user experience, visit our [End User Invitation Experience in {{ en.PHUB }} Business](/hub/getting-started/get-started-hub-business/invite-users-hub-business/end-user-invitation-experience/) topic.
