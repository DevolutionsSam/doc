The administrator can [Invite Users to log in with single sign-on (SSO)](/hub/getting-started/get-started-sso-hub-business/invite-users-SSO-hub-business/) , which is a way to identify a user with a single identifier, to {{ en.PHUB }} Business. The end user invitation experience is different with SSO, as the email the user receives asks them to use the &quot;Sign in with Microsoft&quot; option to log in. If this is the case, please refer to our [End User Invitation Experience for SSO](/hub/getting-started/get-started-sso-hub-business/invite-users-SSO-hub-business/end-user-experience/) topic.

Users that are invited to join {{ en.PHUB }} Business by an administrator receive an invitation email. This email varies depending on whether or not the user has a {{ en.DA }} and on the settings of the administrator who sent the invitation. To learn how to invite users, visit [this topic](/hub/web-interface/hub-overview/administration/management/users/create-invite-users/) .  

For information regarding the user&apos;s first login to {{ en.PHUB }} Business, visit one of the sections below based on the user&apos;s situation.  

* [Invitee with no {{ en.DA }}](#invitee-with-no--enda)  
* [Invitee with an existing {{ en.DA }}](#invitee-with-an-existing--enda)  

To skip the login instructions and go straight to essential features of {{ en.PHUB }} Business, go to the [First Steps in {{ en.PHUB }} Business](#first-steps-in--enphub--business) section.  

## First Login 

### Invitee with no {{ en.DA }} 

If the user does not have a {{ en.DA }} , they will need a [Temporary Password](/hub/web-interface/hub-overview/administration/management/users/create-invite-users/temporary-password/) to access {{ en.PHUB }} Business. The administrator who invited the user may include this password in the invitation email or not.  

If the temporary password is included , the user receives an invitation email with a link to {{ en.PHUB }} Business with their temporary password.

If the temporary password is not included , the user receives an invitation email with a link to {{ en.PHUB }} Business and a notice that the administrator will soon forward them the temporary password.
