eleventyComputed:
  title: Invalid {{ en.HUBB }} Serial Key
---
When trying to add a serial key to {{ en.HUBB }}, if there are already a greater number of users created for that {{ en.HUB }} than the maximum number of users for that key, it will give the "Invalid {{ en.HUBB }} serial key" error.

## Solution
Contact the [Devolutions sales department](mailto:sales@devolutions.net) to adjust the number of users needed for that license.

Alternatively, if some users were created by mistake, the administrator can delete them by going through the web interface to ***Administration*** â€“ ***Users***.
