title: Private Key Storage Methods
---
The method of storing your Private Key depends of whether you have a {{ en.DA }} or not: 
* If you already have a {{ en.DA }}, your Private Key will be stored using a password, the same one used to connect to your {{ en.DA }}.
* If you do not have a {{ en.DA }}, you will be prompted to choose a storage method for your Private Key. After following the steps, your {{ en.DA }} will be created using the selected method.

Your Private Key is mandatory in case you access your {{ en.HUB }} from a new device or a private browsing session. You will have to validate your identity using one of the methods below. These methods can be configured and changed in your [Devolutions Portal](https://portal.devolutions.com/security/private-key).
* Mobile Device **(Recommended)**: Your Private Key can be stored on the [Devolutions Workspace mobile app](https://devolutions.net/workspace/). You will receive a push notification to easily approve new devices. This method is recommended because there is no need to remember a password or store your QR code somewhere. This is especially useful for access from a new device or a private browsing session, as your password is not stored in your browser in this situation.
* QR Code: Download and print your Private Key as a QR code. When required to approve new devices, you will need to scan the QR Code.
* Password: Approve new devices by entering a password, the same as your {{ en.DA }}.
