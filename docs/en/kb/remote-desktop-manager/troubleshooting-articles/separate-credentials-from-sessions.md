title: Separate Credentials from Sessions
---
The ***Merge credential list with session*** option in {{ en.RDM }} version 2021.1.27 and higher was deprecated.
## Solution
The workaround is to create a credential folder at the root of your vault and move your credentials entries inside.  

If needed an [Advanced search](https://help.remotedesktopmanager.com/advanced_search.html) can be done to locate the credentials entries.

If you are using the inherited feature, you will need to edit your folder structure accordingly.
