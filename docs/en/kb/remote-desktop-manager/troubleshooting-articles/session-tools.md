When you attempt to use ***Computer Management*** , you receive the error below:

### Solution
To get this working, you need to check this option in the ***Management Tools*** tab of the RDP session.

If this doesn't solve your issue, it is likely that your session has ***User Specific Settings*** enabled.  

This can be useful when you are using tools such as:  

* Hyper-V  
* Event Viewer  
* Computer Management  
* Windows Services  

If this is often needed, we recommend you to change the ***Default Settings*** of the entry type. With this modification, all your new sessions will use the specified credentials when a tool is launched.
