title: SSH Application Keypad not Working
---
Application keypad not working correctly.  

When trying to use the keypad in SSH, it does not send the correct characters when you type.
### Solution
In the ***Terminal*** tab, set the ***Disable application keypad mode*** to ***True*** so that the option works globally on all your sessions.
