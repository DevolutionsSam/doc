title: Active Directory Synchronizer Error
---
Entries are created with a *cnf:{guid} suffix or Host name is appended with cnf, and the entry name also contains a guid suffix.
## Solution
This is a problem caused by Multimaster replication of directory objects. When there are name collisions, the system automatically renames one of the accounts by appending CNF to indicate conflict resolution and a GUID which is guaranteed to be unique.  

There is a command to run to remove these objects, namely repadmin/removelingeringobject , please consult these references for the recipe to follow.
