title: IOException - The Process Cannot Access the File
---
IOException - The process cannot access the file 'C:\Users\*User*\AppData\Local\Temp\RDM\record.mp4' because it is being used by another process.  

***Solution***

This error can be avoided by adding a variable to the name of your recording. That way, RDM won't have issues trying to overwrite an already existing recording. In general, we recommend using variables such as $DATE_TEXT$ or $TIME_TEXT$ to identify recording.  

For example, if you changed your path to  

C:\Users\*User*\AppData\Local\Temp\RDM\record-$DATE_TEXT$-$TIME-TEXT$.mp4  

The name of your recording would look something like " record-2202020-100257.mp4 " This will ensure that each recording has a unique name.
