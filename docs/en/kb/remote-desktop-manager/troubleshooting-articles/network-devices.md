It is possible to manage different devices via a web interface. However, you may have some issues to connect to the web interface in the ***Embedded (tabbed)*** display mode.  

For example, you may encounter issues with the following devices:  

* Nagios
* Cisco
* Dell SonicWall  

### Solution
We use third party libraries for the integration of Firefox and Google Chrome in the ***Embedded (tabbed)*** display mode.  

If none of the web browsers work in ***Embedded (tabbed)*** display mode, you would need to launch the website using the External display mode and use our {{ en.DWL }} to handle the credentials.
