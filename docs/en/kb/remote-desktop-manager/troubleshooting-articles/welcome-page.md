title: Welcome Page
---
We added a new ***Getting Started*** page at the opening of {{ en.RDM }} but you don't want to see it every time you open our application.  

There are 2 ways of removing that page:  

If you haven't closed it yet, click on ***Don't show again*** in the upper left corner.

Or go in ***File - Options - User Interface*** and uncheck ***Show Welcome page at start-up***

### Custom welcome page
It is possible to display your own welcome page at startup.  

Under ***Administration*** in the ribbon, choose ***Data Source Settings (System Settings)*** Then, in ***Applications*** , under the ***Welcome Page*** section, enter the URL that points to your custom welcome page.
