# {{ en.TOPICTITLE }}
The Cisco AnyConnect add-on doesn&apos;t send the proper information like the password or the group number to the vpncli.exe DOS window to establish the VPN connection.  

For example, only the half of the password is sent to the Cisco AnyConnect window.
### Solution
The Cisco AnyConnect add-on use sendkeys to send information to the vpncli.exe window. The issue that we encounter is caused by the Windows UAC feature. Enabling/Disabling UAC on your computer should resolve the issue.
1. On your computer, go in ***Control Panel – User Account – User Account Control Settings***
1. Select ***Never Notify*** to turn off the option.
1. Select ***Notify me*** or ***Always notify*** to turn the option on.
