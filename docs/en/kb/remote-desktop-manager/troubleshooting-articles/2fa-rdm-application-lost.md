This solution applies if you have set a 2FA or an Application password on your {{ en.RDM }} application in ***File - Options - Security*** and lost your phone or lock yourself out of the application.
## Solution

For the Free: %localappdata%\Devolutions\RemoteDesktopManager\Free  
{% endsnippet %}  

3. Launch {{ en.RDM }}
