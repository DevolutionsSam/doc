### Problem 1
When running PowerShell (RDM CmdLet) after deploying {{ en.RDM }} from the *.zip file, you might see an error message like the following:  

Exception occurred while initializing the installation:  

System.IO.FileLoadException: Could not load file or assembly &apos;file<area>:///C:\Tools\Devolutions\RDM\RDM For Phone Support\RemoteDesktopManager.PowerShell.dll&apos; or one of its dependencies. Operation is not supported. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131515).

### Solution 1
You must unblock ***RemoteDesktopManager.PowerShell.dll*** &amp; ***RemoteDesktopManager.Core.XmlSerializers.dll*** The 2 files are located in the installation folder of {{ en.RDM }}  

Right-click on ***RemoteDesktopManager.PowerShell.dll*** &amp; ***RemoteDesktopManager.Core.XmlSerializers.dll*** and select ***Properties*** then click on ***Unblock***

### Problem 2
Cannot load Windows PowerShell snap-in Remote.Desktop.Manager.10.0.4 because of the following error:  

Could not load file or assembly &apos;file<area>:///C:\Program Files (x86)\Devolutions\Remote Desktop Manager\RemoteDesktopManager.PowerShell.dll&apos; or one of its dependencies. This assembly is built by a runtime newer than the currently loaded runtime and cannot be loaded.
### Solution 2
PowerShell v.4.0 needs to be installed. To get your PowerShell version, execute the following command: $PSVersionTable
### Problem 3
None of the Powershell cmdlets in {{ en.RDM }} work after an update, even if they were running correctly prior to the update.
### Solution 3
The first step is to check how many versions of the RDM snap-in are currently installed on the computer. Just type this command in Powershell (RDM CmdLet) :  

Get-PSSnapin -name Remote.Desktop.Manager.*  
![KB4117.png](/img/en/kb/KB4117.png)  
If there are more than one version of the snap-in installed, the result of the command will list them like this :  
![KB4118.png](/img/en/kb/KB4118.png)  
To remove snap-ins that do not match with the actual version of {{ en.RDM }} installed on the computer, use the ***Remove-PSSnapin*** cmdlet, ensure you specify the specific version to remove.

Finally, verify if only the snap-in of the current version of RDM is installed with the Get-PSSnapin command.
