## Solution
To resolve this issue, you need to disable the QuickConnect button in Team Viewer by unchecking the option ***Extra – Options – Advanced – Show advanced options – QuickConnect button – Configure – Show QuickConnect button***  

This solution can also be applied to other applications such as Filezilla or Firefox.
