title: How to Configure VPN for Multiple Sessions
---
{{ en.RDM }} automates opening a VPN when launching a remote session. This configuration is well suited to situations where you need one VPN for a group of servers at a remote location. This procedure sets the VPN configurations on the folder and the entries inherit the settings.

### Configure the vpn settings on the parent folder entry

1. Right-click the folder entry and open its ***Properties***.

1. Under the ***General*** section, in the ***Type*** drop-down list, click on ***Session***.
1. In the ***Connect*** drop-down list, select how the VPN opens when you launch a remote session. We recommend choosing ***Connect if unable to ping/port scan*** on the folder. We will have to set each session entry to ***Inherited*** later.  
   | Option                               | Description |
   | ------------------------------------ | ----------- |
   | Not enabled                          | The VPN does not open when the session is open. |
   | Always connect                       | The VPN always opens when the session is open. |
   | Connect manually                     | The VPN requires users to manually open the VPN before launching the session. |
   | Connect if unable to ping/port scan  | {{ en.RDM }} automatically tests if the host responds, if not the VPN opens. |
   | Inherited                            | The VPN inherits the settings from the parent folder. |
   | Ask for confirmation to connect      | The VPN prompts for confirmation before opening. |
   | Connect if network adapter not found | {{ en.RDM }} tests if network adapter is installed and active, if not the VPN opens. |
   | Prompt if unable to ping/scan        | {{ en.RDM }} tests if the host responds, if not the VPN prompts for confirmation before opening. |

1. In the ***Close*** drop-down list, select how the VPN closes at the end of a remote session.  
   | Option             | Description |
   | ------------------ | ----------- |
   | On session close   | The VPN closes automatically when the session is closed. |
   | Manually later     | The VPN requires users to manually close the VPN entry when finished. |
   | Confirm disconnect | The VPN prompts to close the VPN when the session is closed. |

1. Create a ***VPN group*** so the VPN only closes when the last session in the ***VPN group*** is closed.
   - Click the plus sign to add a new ***VPN group*** , then enter a group name. Click ***OK*** when the name is entered.
