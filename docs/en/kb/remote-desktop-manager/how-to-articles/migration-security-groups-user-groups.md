title: Migration from Security Groups to User Groups
---
{% snippet icon.badgeCaution %}
To manage your users permissions, we recommend you switch from ***Security Groups*** (deprecated) to [***Permissions***](https://helprdm.devolutions.net/securitysystem_permissions.html) Once the migration done, disable the legacy [security](https://api.devolutions.net/redirection/70fd53bc-a596-4cb0-8bf8-48c647c2158a) , by unchecking ***Use legacy security*** in ***Administration - System Settings - Security Settings***
{% endsnippet %}  

In {{ en.RDM }} the access to your objects can be secured and managed using the ***User Groups Based Access Control*** This type of security gives you a more granular control over your security.  

For more information please refer to this link: [User Groups Based Access Control](https://helprdm.devolutions.net/securitysystem.htm)  

We also have 2 scenarios in order to get you started with this type of Security:    

* [Simplified Security](https://helprdm.devolutions.net/rolebasedsecuritysystem_simplifiedsecurity.htm)  
* [Advanced Security](https://helprdm.devolutions.net/rolebasedsecuritysystem_advancedsecurity.htm)
