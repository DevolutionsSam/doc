![KB4566.png](/img/en/kb/KB4566.png)  
Sessions that support Run As will have a Run As tab where you specify which credentials to use when starting with Run As.

| Option                      | Description |
| --------------------------- | ----------- |
| None                        | No Run As is performed. |
| Current session             | Use the same credentials as defined in the session. |
| Custom credentials          | Use specified custom credentials. |
| Credential repository       | Use a link credential entry. |
| Use my personal credentials | Use a link personal credential entry. |

## Macros/Scripts/Tools

With tools session types you only need to specify ***Run as different user*** in ***Advanced*** tab. At execution time the credentials will be resolved and used to start the Windows Credentials unless you select ***Use session credentials*** , in which case it will use those active for the session.

## Notes

Run as Different User and Run As Administrator are mutually exclusive.

Run as Different User doesn't allow for Shell Execute

### Example: Command line session with Run as different user on the same workgroup/domain

1. Create a new Command Line session.
