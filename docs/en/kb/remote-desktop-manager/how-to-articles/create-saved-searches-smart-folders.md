# {{ en.TOPICTITLE }}
Smart folders are saved searches. You can search by entry name and/or tag.  

The smart folder lists search results in the dashboard. You can open and edit entries directly from the smart folder.  

The smart folder updates dynamically; each time you open the folder it searches.  
### Add a smart folder
1. Click ***New Entry***
1. Click ***Miscellaneous*** , then select ***Smart Folder***
1. Name the smart folder. This is how the smart folder name will appear in the navigation pane. It is not for the search terms.
1. Enter a search parameter: ***Tags*** or ***Entry name***  

To choose tags, click ***More options*** A list of tags you have used is available.  

To add tags for individual entries, go to the ***More*** section in ***Properties***  
{% snippet icon.badgeNotice %}
A tag will automatically be deleted from the list of tags when not used by any entry. To remove a tag from the list, do an Advanced search by Tags. Select all the entries, in the result window, and by right-clicking select ***Edit - Batch Edit*** ***Override the tags*** in the ***Description*** menu, deselect the tag you want to delete and click ***OK***
