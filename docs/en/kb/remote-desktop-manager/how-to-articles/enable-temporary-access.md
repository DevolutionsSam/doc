title: Enable Temporary Access
---
With the ***Temporary Access*** feature, you can provide a designated user with temporary access to an entry during a designated time frame. This is much more secure than changing the user’s access rightsà and then changing them back once the task is done.  

{% snippet icon.badgeCaution %}
These settings are only available for the {{ en.DPS }}, Microsoft SQL Server, and Microsoft Azure SQL advanced data sources.
{% endsnippet %}
