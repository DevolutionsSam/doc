title: Enable Temporary Access
---
With the ***Temporary Access*** feature, you can provide a designated user with temporary access to an entry during a designated time frame. This is much more secure than changing the userâ€™s access rights, and then changing them back once the task is done.

These settings are only available for the advanced data sources Devolutions Server, Microsoft SQL Server, and Microsoft Azure SQL.
