title: Portable RDM Installation
---
The Devolutions support staff might request you to try a portable {{ en.RDM }} installation to isolate the application from a potential issue tied to a local file, configuration, or specific setting corruption.

To do so, you will need to perform the following steps:

1. Download the [Free](https://devolutions.net/remote-desktop-manager/home/downloadfree) or [Team](https://devolutions.net/remote-desktop-manager/home/downloadenterprise) {{ en.RDM }} ***ZIP*** file.
1. Create a new folder on your ***Desktop***.
1. Extract the content of the ***ZIP*** file into the folder created at step 2.
1. Go in this folder once the ***ZIP*** file has been extracted and run:
   - RemoteDesktopManager64.exe  
   or
   - RemoteDesktopManagerFree.exe
5. Enter your current serial.  

If the issue is resolved, you can use the portable {{ en.RDM }} application has is. That being said, we would recommend that you use it as your main installation.  

To do so, you will need to do the following:

## Relocate the {{ en.RDM }} portable installation

The following steps are built around the fact that you are using the default SQLite data source created by {{ en.RDM }} upon initial installation. If this is not your case, jump to step 4.

1. Go under your %localappdata%\Devolutions\RemoteDesktopManager or %localappdata%\Devolutions\RemoteDesktopManager\Free folder.
1. Locate the ***Connections.db*** file tied to your SQLite data source.
1. Copy it inside your portable version of {{ en.RDM }}.
1. Move the content of your RemoteDesktopManager folder in a backup folder you will create. In doing so, you will have access to a backup of your local configuration of {{ en.RDM }} if needed later on.
1. Copy the content of your portable version of {{ en.RDM }} into the RemoteDesktopManager folder located under your %localappdata%\Devolutions\RemoteDesktopManager or %localappdata%\Devolutions\RemoteDesktopManager\Free. In doing so, your portable version of {{ en.RDM }} will now be your local installation.
1. Create a new shortcut of {{ en.RDM }} using the RemoteDesktopManager64.exe or RemoteDesktopManagerFree.exe contained in this folder.
1. Launch {{ en.RDM }}.
1. Access your data.
   - If you are using the default SQLite data source and you moved your ***Connections.db*** file as per the above steps 1 to 3, the application should automatically connect and you should have access to your data.
   - If you are using a different type of data source than SQLite, you will need to create and map it in {{ en.RDM }} as shown in this topic: [Create a data source](https://help.remotedesktopmanager.com/create-a-new-data-source.html).
