{{ en.RDM }} has an excellent support for running under a Remote Desktop Services environment. A master configuration file can be created to distribute settings for all new users of the system or even to update existing user&apos;s configuration. Please see the [Terminal Services - Remote Desktop Services](https://help.remotedesktopmanager.com/installation_terminalservices.html) page for more information.
