title: VPN Routing
---
# {{ en.TOPICTITLE }}
Establishing a VPN connection using {{ en.RDM }} is simple. Unfortunately, adding routes has to be done manually. Wait for the adapter to connect, find the IP, then add the desired routes. Even if you use a script (such as a PowerShell script), it remains a redundant, time consuming task.

### Solution
This feature is part of a larger concept called VPN Commands. It allows you to run any type of script or executable post-VPN-connect and pre-VPN-disconnect.

### Workflow
1. Configure the VPN to wait until the adapter connects and gets assigned an IP (we will be using the adapterâ€™s IP to define the routes).
1. Click on ***Add*** to display the &#32; ***Commands*** dialog.
1. Create a route definition by selecting the ***Route (Add/Remove)*** &#32; radio item.
1. Set the IP and any other required information.
