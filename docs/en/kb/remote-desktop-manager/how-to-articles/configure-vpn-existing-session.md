title: How to Configure a VPN with an Existing Session
---
Follow this procedure to configure in {{ en.RDM }} a VPN entry with an existing session.

In this example we are launching a ***Website*** session entry first then the RDP.

For this you will need to configure a VPN inside the RDP session and this VPN will launch the ***Website*** session entry.

## Method

You will need to first create a ***Website*** session entry with the URL and then do the following:

1. Go in the ***Properties*** of your second RDP entry, under ***VPN/SSH/Gateway***.
1. Set ***Open*** to ***Always connect***.
1. Set ***Type*** to ***Session***.

Once this is done, use the RDM Jump feature to launch your second RDP entry which will first open the ***Website*** session entry you have configured as a VPN to establish the connection.
