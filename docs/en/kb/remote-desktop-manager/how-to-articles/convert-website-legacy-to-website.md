title: Convert a Website (Legacy) Entry to a Website Entry
---
# {{ en.TOPICTITLE }} 
Since version 2022.2.12 of {{ en.RDM }} , the ***Web Browser*** session entry type is now known as ***Website*** , and the old ***Website*** information entry type has been renamed to ***Website (Legacy)*** , as it is a deprecated entry type. 
Follow the steps below to learn how to convert your ***Website (Legacy)*** entry to a ***Website*** entry type in {{ en.RDM }} using ***Special Actions*** .

To convert several entries at once, you can perform a batch conversion by searching by ***Connection type*** with the ***Advanced Search*** feature. If your entries are in different vaults, you can use the ***Multi Vault Search*** to get the same results. First make sure your vault(s) contain ***Website (Legacy)*** entries, otherwise the entry type will not appear in the search options. Visit our [Batch Edit](https://help.remotedesktopmanager.com/commands_batchedit.html) topic for more information.
