# {{ en.TOPICTITLE }}
It is possible in {{ en.RDM }} to remove a previously trusted fingerprint for a host.  

This information is saved in a file called ***known_host***  

It is located by default at the installation of {{ en.RDM }} here: %LocalAppData%\Devolutions\RemoteDesktopManager  

If you are not installed in the default path, it will be located in the same folder as your {{ en.RDM }} executable file.
