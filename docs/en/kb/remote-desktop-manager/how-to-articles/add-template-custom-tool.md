title: Add a Template as a Custom Tool
---
Get access to a one-click ***Custom Tool*** which would apply a ***Template*** automatically to one of your connections in {{ en.RDM }} The main goal of this solution is to save you a few clicks since launching an entry with a ***Template*** would require that you follow all these steps:

1. Select one of your entries.
1. Right-click on it.
1. Select ***Open with Parameters***.
1. Select ***Open with a Template***.
1. Choose the ***Template*** you wish to use in the list.

The method below, will give you a quick access in RDM’s Dashboard ***Macros/Scripts/Tools*** section of the entry. It will allow you to click on the ***Custom Tool*** and open the connection that currently has focus with the parameters specified in your ***Templates***.
