It is possible to use multiple Edge website entries that each use different credentials. By using ***Profile names***, it makes it possible to have a certain profile any number of times, making each unique or repeating it as many time as needed.

## Steps
1. Go into the ***Properties*** of a ***Website*** entry.  
{% snippet icon.badgeInfo %}
Make certain the ***Display*** option is set to ***Embedded (tabbed)***, or these steps may not work.
{% endsnippet %}

2. Set the ***Web browser*** option to ***Microsoft Edge***, in the ***Common*** – ***General*** – ***General*** tab.
