title: Keep Tabs Opened
---
{{ en.RDM }} offers you the possibility of keeping a tab open even when disconnected, allowing you to restart a remote device or simply keep your worksapce set up to quickly resume after a work interruption.

### Workflow

Your session must be running in embedded mode. Once your session is open, you&apos;ll notice the ***Keep tab on disconnect*** option in the ***Settings*** section of your ***Actions*** tab.

Enable the ***Keep tab on disconnect*** to be able to perform a logoff or restart while keeping the tab present. A panel will replace the content of the session.

This panel offers multiple actions:  

* Close : You changed your mind and want to close the tab.
* Connect : Connect the session.
* Connect When Available : Pings the host until it becomes available, then connects the session.  

If you wish to have the option enabled by default, edit your session and set the ***Keep tab page opened on disconnect*** option in ***Files - Options - Types*** to ***Yes***
