title: Add a Template as a Custom Tool
---

You would like to have access to a one click **Custom Tool** which would apply a **Template** automatically to one of your connections in Remote Desktop Manager. The main goal of this solution is to save you a few clicks since launching an entry with a **Template** would require that you follow all these steps:

1. Select one of your entries.
2. Right-click on it.
3. Select **Open with Parameters**.
4. Select **Open with a Template**.
5. Choose the **Template** you wish to use in the list.

The method below, will give you a quick access in RDMâ€™s Dashboard **Macros/Scripts/Tools** section of the entry. It will allow you to click on the **Custom Tool** and open the connection that currently has focus with the parameters specified in your **Templates**.
