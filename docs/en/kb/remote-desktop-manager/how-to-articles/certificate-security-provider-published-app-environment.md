# {{ en.TOPICTITLE }}
When configuring a Certificate Security Provider in a published app environment (Citrix, RemoteApp, XenApp) as a Security Provider, the user who will run {{ en.RDM }} in the RemoteApp environment (Citrix) will require a Read permission on the certificate. If the Read permission isn&apos;t correctly set, {{ en.RDM }} will generate the CryptographicException - Keyset does not exist error dialog.
