{% snippet icon.badgeNotice %} 
In the context of licensing, a user is an individual that uses {{ en.RDM }}. Credentials that are stored within {{ en.RDM }} have no impact on licensing. 
{% endsnippet %}
 
{% snippet icon.badgeInfo %} 
Licenses are calculated **per user**, not per installation. There is no limitation on installing {{ en.RDM }} (laptop, desktop, home computer, etc), as long as you hold the proper number of licenses for each individual that connect to your system. 
{% endsnippet %}
 
{% snippet icon.badgeCaution %} 
The licenses are for use by the customer that appears on the invoice. You cannot share your license with a sub-contractor or, in the case of a service provider, to one's customers. This applies even if you grant them access to a shared data source.

Three types of licenses are available for purchase, depending on the number of users: 
* **Single User License**: These licenses are purchased individually. There must be a separate license for each individual who will have access to the software. This is akin to a **named user license**. 
* **Enterprise License**: This license offers a maximum of 50 users. 
* **Platinum License**: This license is for 51 users and more.
