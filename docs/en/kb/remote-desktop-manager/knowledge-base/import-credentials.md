title: Import Credentials

{{ en.RDM }} imports credentials from 16 third-party applications. It is an efficient way to build your data. The imported information can be converted into different types of entry (e.g. username/password, Login (account), and Website).  

You can use credential entries to open remote connections, saved as sessions in {{ en.RDM }}. Credential repositories link one credential or a list of credentials with a session.  

To see the types of information you can import, go to ***File â€“ Import***
