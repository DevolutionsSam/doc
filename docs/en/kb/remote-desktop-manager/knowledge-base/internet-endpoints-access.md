This is the list of addresses that are accessed by {{ en.RDM }} during normal operation, as well as the setting(s) to disable/prevent this access.  

{% snippet icon.badgeWarning %}
{{ en.RDM }} is a tool that integrates more than 150 technologies. This list ONLY contains the endpoints that are accessed by the core product itself. We use a "best effort" approach to maintain this list, but it does **NOT** replace proper IT security practices. If security is paramount, it would be better to first block all internet access, then allowlist desired addresses as needed.

{% snippet icon.shieldNotice %}
As part of a standard visit to a website using the HTTPS protocol, the certificate used by the remote site is validated using industry best practices. A certificate contains multiple URLs which will be accessed to perform validation. The URLs vary not only for each site, but also in time whenever they are renewed. Read [Certificate Validation](/kb/remote-desktop-manager/knowledge-base/certificate-validation) for further information.
