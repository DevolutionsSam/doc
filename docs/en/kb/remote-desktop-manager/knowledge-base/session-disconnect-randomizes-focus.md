When disconnecting from a remote session, the focus of the active tab may not be the one you want. This gives the impression that {{ en.RDM }} is selecting the tab randomly.  
## Solution
This is a known issue when the operating system (OS) is Windows 7. The recommendation would be to upgrade to at least Windows 10.
