title: Memory Tuning of RDP Sessions
---
By default, the RDP protocol will reserve a sizable chunk of memory right from the start of a session for caching purposes, but we have some level of control over that. In the ***Experience*** tab of the RDP session, there is a ***Cache*** setting that you can use to control the behavior. It&apos;s values are as follows:  

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>
VALUE
		</th>
		<th>
DESCRIPTION
		</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
Default
		</td>
		<td>
Uses the value set in File - Options - Types - Remote Desktop - Cache
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
Full Mode
		</td>
		<td>
The protocol is full Windows 8 Remote Desktop Protocol cache.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
Thin client
		</td>
		<td>
The protocol is limited to using the Windows 7 with SP1 RemoteFX codec and a smaller cache. All other codecs are disabled. This protocol has the smallest memory footprint
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
Small cache
		</td>
		<td>
The protocol is the same as ***Full mode*** , except it uses a smaller cache.
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Choosing ***Thin client*** is therefore the choice that limits memory consumption the most, but will downgrade to the previous version of the protocol. The ***Small Cache*** mode may be sufficient for your needs if you need the newer features of the RDP protocol.

You might wish to set this for all sessions. In this case, go to File - Options - Types - Remote Desktop to assign the default value, then in all of your sessions use ***Default***
