For {{ en.RDM }} version 2021.2. and higher please refer to topic [PAM Partner Integration](/kb/remote-desktop-manager/knowledge-base/pam-partner-integration/)

In {{ en.RDM }} , our default choice for adding new features has always been to add them to our most basic commercial license, namely the ENTERPRISE Edition. In the case of our Privileged Access Management (PAM) partners, we have to require one of our larger team licenses starting with a SITE license.

This is justified by the considerable amount of time needed, not only for coding support of those extensive systems, but also by the legal and compliance requirements that such relationships entail.

Please contact our [Inside Sales team](mailto:sales@devolutions.net) if you need to upgrade your existing license.
