# {{ en.TOPICTITLE }}
Main RDM clients and {{ en.DPS }} are written using thenet plaform, which means that the capabilities are often derived fromnet libraries themselves.  

As such, supported availability groups are a feature of the database driver used. All types are therefore supported:  

* Multi-Subnet Failover  
* Application Intent  
* Read-Only Routing  
* Multi-Subnet Failover: Faster Single Subnet Endpoint Failover  
* Multi-Subnet Failover: Named Instance Resolution For SQL Clustered Instances
