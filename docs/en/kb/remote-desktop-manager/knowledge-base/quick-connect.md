![KB4447.png](/img/en/kb/KB4447.png)  
{{ en.RDM }} offers default templates to connect with the Quick Connect feature, but it is possible to use [custom templates](https://help.remotedesktopmanager.com/commands_creatingtemplates.html) In that case, the ***host*** field in the template must be set to the $QUICK_CONNECT$ variable. When they are created, custom templates are automatically added at the bottom of the type list.
