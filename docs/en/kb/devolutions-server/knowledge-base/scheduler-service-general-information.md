## Configuration and Requirements

The ***Scheduler*** is a Windows Service. It is installed from the {{ en.DVLSCONSOLE }} ***Install Scheduler***. The ***Scheduler*** will be installed and available from the Windows Services Console, ***DevolutionsSchedulerService***.

This service requires access to the {{ en.DVLS }} database and to specific locations on the file system. Depending on whether {{ en.DVLS }} is configured to use Integrated Security or SQL accounts, different settings must be applied.

Refer to the ***VaultSchedulerService*** account in [Pre-Deployment Account Survey](/kb/devolutions-server/knowledge-base/pre-deployment-account-survey/).
{% endsnippet %}

### When using Integrated Security

* The ***Scheduler*** will use the identity set to the account in Windows Services (services.msc).
* The AD service account requires the ***Read*** permission on the encryption key file (<web app path>\App_Data\encryption.config).
* The AD service account also requires a ***Read*** permission for the ***NetFrameworkConfigurationKey*** container from theNET’s RsaProtectedConfigurationProvider.

Refer to [Encrypting the web.config File](/kb/devolutions-server/how-to-articles/encrypting-web-config-file/).
{% endsnippet %}

### When using SQL Accounts

* The identity used against the database is set in the {{ en.DVLSCONSOLE }} in ***Server – Edit – Database***, ***Scheduler Service***.
* The service runs by default with Network Service. This account cannot decrypt a web.config file by default, and it is not recommended to do so without proper knowledge.

## Enable Scheduler Logging

1. In the {{ en.DVLS }} web UI, go to ***Administration – Server Settings – Logging***.
1. Check ***Log debug information***, then specify a ***Scheduler log path*** to store the log files. The folder location is relative to the scheduler service (C:\ is the C drive of the server).
![Log debug information and Scheduler log path](/img/en/kb/KB2237.png)
1. Save your changes before leaving the ***Logging*** section.
1. If it is not already the case, configure the identity running the scheduler so that it has the ***Write*** permission since it must write in the folder.
1. Restart the ***Scheduler Service***.
