If the ***Service Scheduler*** is not showing in your ***Dashboard***, it may be because it was installed using an older version of the {{ en.DVLSCONSOLE }}.

## Solution

1. Install the latest version of the [{{ en.DVLSCONSOLE }}](https://devolutions.net/server/home/download).
1. Reinstall the ***Service Scheduler*** using this newer version of the console.
