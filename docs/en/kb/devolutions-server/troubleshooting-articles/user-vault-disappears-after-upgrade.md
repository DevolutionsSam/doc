title: User Vault Disappears after Upgrade
---
With {{ en.DPS }} 2021 came a remodeling of the User Vaults. After upgrading to 2021.1.x and higher some user could no longer be able to access their ***User Vault***  

Different behaviours can be observed:  

* <a href="#one">Empty User Vault on both {{ en.RDM }} and the web {{ en.DPS }} UI</a>
* <a href="#both">Empty User Vault in {{ en.RDM }}, but it is showing on the web {{ en.DPS }} UI</a>

### Empty User Vault on both {{ en.RDM }} and the web {{ en.DPS }} UI
<a name="one"></a>

In most cases, this is caused by the migration process causing a ***Validation Conflict*** and will only affect some users.  

1. Open the user web {{ en.DPS }} and click on his ***Avatar*** in the right upper corner.
1. In the menu, you should see an ***Export*** &#32; ***Nonmigrated User Vault*** and a ***Delete*** &#32; ***Nonmigrated User Vault*** option.

1. Click on ***Export Nonmigrated User Vault*** to create a password protectedrdm file.
1. Import the data file in an empty Local Data source to test and ensure the integrity of the data.
1. When your validation is conclusive, click on ***Delete Nonmigrated User Vault***
1. Import therdm file in the {{ en.DPS }} data source.

### Empty User Vault in {{ en.RDM }} , but it is showing on the web {{ en.DPS }} UI
<a name="both"></a>

Usually, this issue is organization wide, and is caused by a ***Security Provider*** still present on the data source.

Available in {{ en.DPS }} 2021.1.10 and higher or the 2020.3.19 LTS version.
{% endsnippet %}  

1. In the {{ en.DVLSCONSOLE }} click on ***Tools - Remove Security Provider***  
{% snippet icon.shieldWarning %}
Removing the ***Security Provider*** will leave your database unencrypted.
{% endsnippet %}  

2. Once itâ€™s completed, click on ***Tools - Regenerate*** and store the file and the password in a safe location.  
{% snippet icon.badgeCaution %}
Regenerating the ***Encryption Keys*** will re-encrypt the database.
{% endsnippet %}
