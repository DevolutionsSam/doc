## Solution

Make sure that the DPSURL parameter in the processor.log file contains a URL that is reachable from the machine where the Recording Server is installed and that the URL does not end with "/".
```
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<Settings>
  <DPSApiKey>xxxxxxxxxxxx</DPSApiKey>
  <DPSApiKeyPasswordEncrypted>xxxxxxxxxxxx</DPSApiKeyPasswordEncrypted>
  <DPSUrl>https://devolutions237.devolutions.loc</DPSUrl>
  <MaxParallelProcess>8</MaxParallelProcess>
  <MonitorFolder>C:\Temp\Recording\collector</MonitorFolder>
  <OutputFolder>C:\Temp\Recording</OutputFolder>
</Settings>
```
