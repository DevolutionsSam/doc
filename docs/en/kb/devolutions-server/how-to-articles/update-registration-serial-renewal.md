{{ en.DPS }} is licensed as a yearly subscription which must be kept up-to-date. A new license key is provided when you renew. The new license key needs to be entered in the {{ en.DPS }} Console.

Your data is always available even if the subscription has expired. You simply need to connect directly to that database using a SQL Server data source.
