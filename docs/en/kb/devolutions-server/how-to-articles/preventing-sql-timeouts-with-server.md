title: Preventing SQL Timeouts with DVLS
---
# {{ en.TOPICTITLE }}
Managing a lot of entries in one single operation or having a high number of connected users could lead to SQL Timeout error messages with {{ en.DPS }}
The following modification on the database advanced parameters could help to prevent getting SQL Timeouts.
1. The first one to consider is the ***Connection maximum pool size*** Increasing that parameter to 1000 instead of the default 100 will help to level up the number of possible database connections.
1. The second parameter is the ***Connection timeout*** that can be increased to 30 seconds. This will make the system wait for 30 seconds before raising an exception.
1. The last one is the ***Connection retry count*** as it will repeat each ***Connection timeout*** delay before generating an error. By setting it to 5, the {{ en.DPS }} instance will wait 150 seconds before raising an SQL Timeout.
