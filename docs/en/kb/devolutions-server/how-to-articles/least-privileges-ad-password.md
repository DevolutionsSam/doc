---
With a PAM Provider account, {{ en.DPS }} allows to rotate account passwords. In Active Directory, having a domain administrator account as the provider can be a bit overkill for password rotation. The following article described the steps to create an Active Directory account that will be used as a PAM Provider and have the ability to rotate passwords in Active Directory.

To manage domain administrator accounts as privileged accounts in the PAM module, the PAM AD provider must be part of the domain administrator groups. Then no need to follow these instructions.

The password rotation feature will use the default built-in {{ en.DPS }} password rules. To level-up the password rules to respect your domain password rules, create a password template in ***Administration - System Settings - Password Template*** Then set it as the default password template in ***Administration - System Settings Password Management - Password Template***
